## My Journey

My career in Devops started after I graduated San Diego State University with a BS in applied mathematics, my first job out of college was in IT helpdesk. DevOps bridged the gap for me between IT and the logical processes in software development.

Throughout my career, I have had the opportunity to contribute to a diverse range of projects, each reinforcing the value of technical excellence and effective collaboration. My ability to stay at the forefront of emerging technologies has enabled me to lead initiatives such as migrating APIs to serverless architectures and developing Kubernetes clusters as a service, empowering developers to independently manage their own open source application deployments.

## My Tech Stack & Skills

I am committed to continuous learning and leveraging modern technologies to deliver impactful solutions. Here are some of the core tools and platforms I use:

*   **Programming Languages:** Terraform, Terragrunt, Python, Go
*   **Cloud Platforms:** AWS, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Microsoft Azure, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)
*   **DevOps & Infrastructure:** Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD pipelines, Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
*   **Collaboration & Version Control:** Git, GitHub, GitLab, VS Code

I have hands-on experience architecting, automating, and optimizing mission-critical deployments, and I thrive in environments that value innovation, reliability, and teamwork.

## Beyond the Keyboard

When I'm not coding, you can find me:

*   Exploring hiking trails ðŸŒ²
*   Working on my homelab ðŸ’»
*   Contributing to open-source projects that I admire.
