### Change Summary
This git diff reflects updates to the Tailscale module within an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) configuration. Specifically, changes are made to the `main.tf` file, focusing on the ArgoCD application configuration for Tailscale. The primary modifications include the removal of certain annotations and an update to the target Helm chart revision.

### Technical Details
- **File Modified:** `IaC/modules/tailscale/main.tf`
- **Resource Affected:** `argocd_application` named "tailscale"
- **Annotations Removed:**
  - `argocd-image-updater.argoproj.io/image-list`
  - `argocd-image-updater.argoproj.io/tailscale.update-strategy`
  - `argocd-image-updater.argoproj.io/tailscale.helm.image-name`
  - `argocd-image-updater.argoproj.io/tailscale.helm.image-tag`
- **Helm Chart Revision Updated:**
  - From `1.82.5` to `1.86.5`

### Key Learnings & Insights
- **Simplification of Configuration:** The removal of annotations suggests a simplification of the configuration, possibly to reduce complexity or because these annotations are no longer necessary due to changes in how image updates are managed.
- **Version Upgrade:** The update to Helm chart revision `1.86.5` indicates an effort to incorporate the latest features, bug fixes, or security patches provided by Tailscale. This demonstrates a commitment to maintaining up-to-date dependencies.

### Impact Assessment
- **Performance & Security:** Upgrading to the latest Helm chart revision could introduce performance improvements and security enhancements. However, it's crucial to review the release notes for `1.86.5` to understand the full scope of changes.
- **Maintainability:** Removing annotations might simplify the configuration, making it easier to maintain. However, it's essential to ensure that the functionality previously provided by these annotations is not needed or has been replaced by another mechanism.

### Developer Notes
- **Review Release Notes:** Before deploying these changes, review the Tailscale Helm chart release notes for `1.86.5` to understand any breaking changes or migration requirements.
- **Test Configuration:** Ensure that the removal of annotations does not adversely affect the image update strategy. It might be necessary to implement alternative configurations or automation to manage image updates.
- **Future Improvements:** Consider documenting the decision-making process behind removing annotations and upgrading the Helm chart revision. This will help future developers understand the rationale and context of these changes.
