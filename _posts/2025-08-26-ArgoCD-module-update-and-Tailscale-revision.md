### Change Summary
This git diff introduces significant changes to the ArgoCD module within the IaC (Infrastructure as Code) repository. The primary modifications include the integration of Azure OAuth for Dex, updates to the Tailscale Helm chart version, and adjustments to Terraform provider versions. 

### Technical Details
- **ArgoCD Module (`IaC/modules/argocd/main.tf`):**
  - Added environment variables for Dex configuration, specifically for Azure OAuth integration.
  - Updated RBAC policy to set a default role.
  - Configured Dex to use Azure as an OAuth connector with specific client details.
  - Introduced an AWS SSM parameter for storing the client secret securely.
  - Created a Kubernetes manifest for an ExternalSecret to manage secrets from AWS SSM.

- **Tailscale Module (`IaC/modules/tailscale/main.tf`):**
  - Updated the Tailscale Helm chart target revision from a fixed version to a wildcard version (`1.*`).

- **Terraform Lock File (`IaC/production/homelab/argocd/.terraform.lock.hcl`):**
  - Updated the AWS provider version to `6.10.0`.
  - Retained the Helm provider version at `2.17.0`.

### Key Learnings & Insights
- **Security Enhancements:** 
  - The integration of Azure OAuth for Dex improves security by leveraging a robust external authentication mechanism.
  - Storing sensitive information like client secrets in AWS SSM and using ExternalSecrets for Kubernetes enhances secret management practices.

- **Flexibility in Dependencies:**
  - Changing the Tailscale Helm chart version to `1.*` allows for more flexibility in updates, ensuring the application can benefit from the latest features and security patches without manual version updates.

- **Modular and Secure Configuration:**
  - The use of `yamlencode` for Dex configuration and ExternalSecrets for secret management demonstrates a modular approach to configuration, making the system more maintainable and secure.

### Impact Assessment
- **Performance:** 
  - The changes are unlikely to have a direct performance impact but may indirectly improve performance by ensuring the system is up-to-date with the latest security patches and features.

- **Security:**
  - Enhanced security through better secret management and OAuth integration.

- **Maintainability:**
  - Improved maintainability by allowing wildcard versioning for Helm charts and centralizing secret management.

### Developer Notes
- **Gotchas:**
  - Ensure that the AWS SSM parameters are correctly set up and that the ExternalSecrets configuration aligns with your Kubernetes cluster's setup.
  - Verify that the Dex configuration aligns with your OAuth provider's requirements.

- **Future Improvements:**
  - Consider automating the update of the AWS SSM parameter values to avoid manual intervention.
  - Explore additional OAuth providers for Dex to offer more authentication options.
