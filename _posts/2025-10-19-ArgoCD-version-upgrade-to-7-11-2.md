  - `IaC/modules/cert-manager/init.tf`
  - `IaC/modules/cloudflare-tunnel/init.tf`
  - `IaC/modules/database/init.tf`
  - `IaC/modules/descheduler/init.tf`
  - `IaC/modules/homarr/init.tf`
  - `IaC/modules/homeassistant/init.tf`
  - `IaC/modules/litellm/init.tf`
  - `IaC/modules/monitoring/init.tf`
  - `IaC/modules/n8n/init.tf`
  - `IaC/modules/octobot/init.tf`
  - `IaC/modules/open-webui/init.tf`
  - `IaC/modules/tailscale/init.tf`
  - `IaC/modules/technitium/init.tf`

- **Change Made:**
  - Updated the `argocd` provider version from `7.8.0` to `7.11.2` in the `required_providers` block of each `init.tf` file.

### Key Learnings & Insights
- **Reasoning Behind the Change:**
  - The update to version `7.11.2` likely includes bug fixes, performance improvements, and new features that are beneficial for the Argo CD operations within these modules.
  
- **Problem-Solving Approach:**
  - A systematic approach was taken to ensure all modules using the `argocd` provider were updated consistently. This reduces the risk of version mismatches and ensures uniformity across the infrastructure code.

- **Best Practices Demonstrated:**
  - Version management is crucial for maintaining the stability and security of infrastructure as code. Regularly updating to the latest stable versions helps in leveraging the latest features and security patches.

- **Trade-offs or Decisions:**
  - While updating to a newer version, itâ€™s important to consider the changelog and release notes to ensure there are no breaking changes that could affect existing configurations. In this case, the minor version bump suggests minimal risk, but thorough testing should still be conducted.

### Impact Assessment
- **Overall System Impact:**
  - This change should enhance the reliability and functionality of Argo CD across all modules. It is expected to improve the deployment and management processes of the applications within these modules.

- **Performance, Security, and Maintainability:**
  - **Performance:** Potential performance improvements from the newer version.
  - **Security:** Likely inclusion of security patches.
  - **Maintainability:** Simplifies maintenance by ensuring all modules use the same version of the provider.

- **Breaking Changes or Migration Requirements:**
  - It is essential to review the Argo CD release notes for version `7.11.2` to check for any breaking changes. If any are found, appropriate migration steps should be planned and executed.

### Developer Notes
- **Gotchas and Edge Cases:**
  - Ensure that all environments (development, staging, production) are updated to the new version to avoid inconsistencies.
  - Verify that there are no deprecated features or altered behaviors in the new version that could affect existing configurations.

- **Context for Future Developers:**
  - Document the rationale for choosing version `7.11.2` and any specific configurations or workarounds implemented during the update process.

- **Potential Future Improvements:**
  - Consider implementing a version management strategy that automates the update process for providers across modules to reduce manual effort and human error.
