### Change Summary
This git diff reflects updates to the infrastructure-as-code (IaC) configurations for two modules: `n8n` and `open-webui`. The changes primarily involve updating the image versions and modifying the update strategies for these applications within an ArgoCD-managed environment.

### Technical Details
- **n8n Module (`IaC/modules/n8n/main.tf`)**:
  - Updated the Docker image from `n8nio/n8n:stable` to `n8nio/n8n:1.102.x`.
  - Changed the update strategy from `digest` to `semver`.
  - Specifically modified the `argocd_application` resource to reflect these changes.

- **open-webui Module (`IaC/modules/open-webui/main.tf`)**:
  - Updated the Docker image from `ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:0.102.x` to `ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:0.x`.
  - Retained the `semver` update strategy.
  - Modified the `argocd_application` resource to incorporate these updates.

### Key Learnings & Insights
- **Versioning Strategy**:
  - The shift from `stable` to specific version ranges (`1.102.x` and `0.x`) indicates a move towards more controlled versioning, allowing for better management of updates and compatibility.
  - Changing the update strategy to `semver` ensures that updates are managed based on semantic versioning, providing a balance between receiving new features and maintaining stability.

- **Problem-Solving Approach**:
  - These changes suggest an effort to enhance the reliability and maintainability of the deployments by ensuring that the applications are running on well-defined version ranges.
  - The use of semantic versioning helps in automating the update process while minimizing the risk of breaking changes.

### Impact Assessment
- **Performance**:
  - There should be no direct performance impact from these changes, as they primarily affect the versioning and update strategy.
  
- **Security**:
  - Using specific version ranges and semantic versioning can help in quickly adopting security patches without exposing the system to unstable updates.

- **Maintainability**:
  - These changes improve maintainability by providing clearer version control and update management, reducing the likelihood of unexpected behavior due to automatic updates.

### Developer Notes
- **Gotchas**:
  - Ensure that the new version ranges are compatible with the existing configurations and dependencies.
  - Monitor the initial rollout to ensure that the semantic versioning strategy aligns with the expected update frequency and stability.

- **Future Improvements**:
  - Consider implementing canary releases or blue-green deployments to further mitigate risks associated with updates.
  - Regularly review and update the version ranges to align with the latest stable releases and security patches.
