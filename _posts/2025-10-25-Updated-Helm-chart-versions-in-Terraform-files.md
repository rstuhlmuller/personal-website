### Change Summary

This git diff reflects updates to the Helm chart versions for two Kubernetes modules: `argocd` and `external-secrets`. Specifically, the `argocd` module has been updated from version `9.0.3` to `9.0.5`, and the `external-secrets` module has been updated from version `0.20.3` to `0.20.4`.

### Technical Details

#### argocd Module
- **File:** `IaC/modules/argocd/main.tf`
- **Change:** Updated the Helm chart version for the `argocd` release.
  ```hcl
  - version    = "9.0.3"
  + version    = "9.0.5"
  ```
- **Implementation:** The version number in the `helm_release` resource has been incremented. This change ensures that the ArgoCD deployment uses the latest features and bug fixes available in version `9.0.5`.

#### external-secrets Module
- **File:** `IaC/modules/external-secrets/main.tf`
- **Change:** Updated the Helm chart version for the `external-secrets` release.
  ```hcl
  - version    = "0.20.3"
  + version    = "0.20.4"
  ```
- **Implementation:** Similar to the `argocd` module, the version number in the `helm_release` resource for `external-secrets` has been incremented to `0.20.4`. This update incorporates the latest improvements and fixes in the External Secrets Operator.

### Key Learnings & Insights

- **Reasoning Behind Changes:** These updates were made to leverage the latest features, security patches, and bug fixes provided in the newer Helm chart versions. Keeping dependencies up-to-date is crucial for maintaining a secure and performant system.
- **Problem-Solving Approach:** The approach involved identifying the current versions in use, checking the release notes for the new versions, and then updating the Terraform configuration to reflect these changes.
- **Best Practices:** Regularly updating dependencies is a best practice in infrastructure as code (IaC). It helps in mitigating security vulnerabilities and taking advantage of new features and optimizations.
- **Trade-offs:** While updating to newer versions can introduce new features and fixes, it may also require testing to ensure compatibility with the existing system. In this case, the minor version updates are unlikely to cause significant disruptions.

### Impact Assessment

- **System Performance:** The updates are expected to have a positive impact on system performance due to potential optimizations and bug fixes in the new versions.
- **Security:** Security implications are likely positive, as newer versions often include patches for known vulnerabilities.
- **Maintainability:** Keeping dependencies up-to-date simplifies maintenance and reduces technical debt.
- **Breaking Changes:** There are no anticipated breaking changes with these minor version updates, but thorough testing is recommended to confirm compatibility.

### Developer Notes

- **Gotchas:** Ensure that the new versions do not introduce any breaking changes or deprecated features that could affect the deployment.
- **Edge Cases:** Pay attention to any custom configurations or overrides that might need adjustment with the new versions.
- **Future Improvements:** Consider setting up a process for automated dependency updates to streamline future maintenance.
