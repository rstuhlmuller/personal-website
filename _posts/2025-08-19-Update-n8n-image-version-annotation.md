### Change Summary
This git diff reflects a modification to the `main.tf` file within the `n8n` module of the Infrastructure as Code (IaC) repository. Specifically, the version specification for the `n8nio/n8n` Docker image has been updated.

### Technical Details
- **File Modified:** `IaC/modules/n8n/main.tf`
- **Change:** 
  - The version of the `n8nio/n8n` Docker image has been updated from `1.102.x` to `1.x`.
  - This change is located within the `argocd_application` resource definition for the `n8n` application.
  - The annotation `argocd-image-updater.argoproj.io/image-list` now points to `n8nio/n8n:1.x` instead of `n8nio/n8n:1.102.x`.

### Key Learnings & Insights
- **Version Flexibility:** 
  - By changing the version specification from `1.102.x` to `1.x`, the configuration now allows for any minor or patch version within the major version 1 to be used. This provides greater flexibility in automatically updating to the latest compatible version.
- **Semver Strategy:**
  - The update strategy remains as `semver`, ensuring that the updates adhere to semantic versioning principles. This means that only compatible changes (i.e., bug fixes and features that do not break existing functionality) will be automatically applied.
- **Maintenance Ease:**
  - This change reduces the need for manual updates to the Docker image version, allowing the system to stay current with minimal intervention.

### Impact Assessment
- **Performance:** 
  - There should be no direct performance impact from this change. However, future updates to the `n8nio/n8n` image may introduce performance improvements or degradations.
- **Security:**
  - Automatically updating to the latest compatible version can enhance security by incorporating the latest patches and fixes.
- **Maintainability:**
  - This change improves maintainability by reducing the need for manual version updates.
- **Breaking Changes:**
  - There are no breaking changes introduced by this modification. However, future updates to the `n8nio/n8n` image might include breaking changes, which should be handled according to the existing update strategy (`semver`).

### Developer Notes
- **Gotchas:**
  - Ensure that the application is thoroughly tested after an automatic update to the `n8nio/n8n` image to catch any potential issues introduced by new versions.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - Be aware that while semantic versioning aims to prevent breaking changes within a major version, there may be edge cases where a minor or patch version introduces unexpected behavior.
- **Future Improvements:**
  - Consider implementing canary releases or blue-green deployments to mitigate risks associated with automatic updates. This would allow for gradual rollouts and easier rollbacks if issues arise.
