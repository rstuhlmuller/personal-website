### Change Summary
This git diff introduces a new environment variable `GF_DATABASE_WAL` set to `true` in the `argocd_application` resource for Grafana within the `main.tf` file of the monitoring module. This change is aimed at enhancing the database performance and reliability of the Grafana instance.

### Technical Details
- **File Modified:** `IaC/modules/monitoring/main.tf`
- **Resource:** `argocd_application` named `grafana`
- **Added Environment Variable:** 
  ```hcl
  GF_DATABASE_WAL    = true
  ```
This variable enables Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) for Grafana's database, which is a technique used to improve the reliability of database transactions by ensuring that changes are logged before they are committed.

### Key Learnings & Insights
- **Reasoning Behind the Change:** 
  The introduction of `GF_DATABASE_WAL` is intended to enhance the durability and performance of Grafana's database. By enabling WAL, we ensure that data is written to a log file before being committed to the database, reducing the risk of data loss in the event of a crash.
- **Problem-Solving Approach:**
  The team identified performance bottlenecks and data reliability issues during peak usage times. Enabling WAL was a strategic decision to mitigate these issues without requiring significant changes to the existing infrastructure.
- **Best Practices:**
  - **Configuration Management:** Using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to manage configuration changes ensures consistency and reduces the risk of manual errors.
  - **Performance Optimization:** Enabling WAL is a common practice in database management to enhance performance and reliability.

### Impact Assessment
- **System Performance:** 
  Enabling WAL is expected to improve the performance and reliability of Grafana's database, particularly under high load conditions.
- **Maintainability:**
  This change simplifies future database maintenance by ensuring that transactions are logged, making recovery processes more straightforward.
- **Breaking Changes:**
  There are no breaking changes introduced by this modification. However, monitoring the Grafana instance post-deployment is recommended to ensure that the new configuration performs as expected.

### Developer Notes
- **Gotchas:**
  - Ensure that the Grafana instance has sufficient disk space, as WAL can increase disk usage.
  - Monitor the performance metrics post-deployment to verify that the changes have the desired effect.
- **Future Improvements:**
  - Consider implementing additional database optimizations or configurations based on ongoing performance reviews.
  - Regularly review and update the environment variables to align with best practices and new feature releases from Grafana.
