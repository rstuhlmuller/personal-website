### Change Summary
This git diff introduces changes to the `main.tf` file within the `homarr` module of the Infrastructure as Code (IaC) repository. The primary modification involves updating the ArgoCD application configuration to manage image updates more effectively.

### Technical Details
- **File Modified:** `IaC/modules/homarr/main.tf`
- **Resource Updated:** `argocd_application` named "homarr"
- **Annotations Added:**
  - `argocd-image-updater.argoproj.io/image-list`: Specifies the Docker image for Homarr as `ghcr.io/homarr-labs/homarr:v1`.
  - `argocd-image-updater.argoproj.io/homarr.update-strategy`: Sets the update strategy to "semver" (semantic versioning).
- **Removed Configuration:**
  - The `parameter` block that set `image.tag` to "latest" has been removed.

### Key Learnings & Insights
- **Effective Image Management:** By specifying a concrete version (`v1`) and employing a semantic versioning strategy, the configuration ensures that image updates are controlled and predictable. This reduces the risk associated with pulling the "latest" image, which can introduce breaking changes.
- **Automation of Updates:** The added annotations leverage ArgoCD's image updater to automate the process of updating container images based on semantic versioning rules. This enhances maintainability and ensures that the deployment pipeline remains up-to-date with minimal manual intervention.
- **Best Practices:** This change aligns with best practices in container management, advocating for the use of specific tags and automated update strategies to maintain system stability and security.

### Impact Assessment
- **Performance:** There should be no direct performance impact from this change. However, automated updates may introduce new versions that could affect performance, necessitating monitoring and rollback strategies.
- **Security:** Using specific version tags and semantic versioning enhances security by avoiding unexpected changes from the "latest" tag, which could include unvetted updates.
- **Maintainability:** The change improves maintainability by automating the update process, reducing the manual effort required to keep the deployment current.

### Developer Notes
- **Gotchas:** Ensure that the specified image (`ghcr.io/homarr-labs/homarr:v1`) exists and is compatible with the current configuration. Monitor the automated updates closely after this change to quickly address any issues that arise from new versions.
- **Future Improvements:** Consider implementing canary releases or blue-green deployments to further mitigate risks associated with automated image updates. Additionally, explore integrating automated testing into the update pipeline to validate new versions before they are deployed.
