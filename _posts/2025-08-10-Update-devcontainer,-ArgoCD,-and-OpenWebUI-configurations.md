### Change Summary

This update involves several modifications across different components of the project. The primary changes include adjustments to the development container configuration, updates to the ArgoCD module for image updates, and the addition of a new AWS documentation module in the Open WebUI module.

### Technical Details

- **Development Container Configuration (`.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`)**:
  - Removed several VS Code extensions:
    - `hashicorp.terraform`
    - `GitHub.copilot`
    - `GitHub.copilot-chat`
    - `eamodio.gitlens`
  - Retained the `hashicorp.hcl` extension.

- **ArgoCD Module (`IaC/modules/argocd/main.tf`)**:
  - Modified the `helm_release` resource for `argocd_image_updater`:
    - Changed the interval for image updates from `6h` to `1h`.

- **Open WebUI Module (`IaC/modules/open-webui/main.tf`)**:
  - Added a new configuration for `awslabs.aws-documentation-mcp-server`:
    - Command: `uvx`
    - Arguments: `["awslabs.aws-documentation-mcp-server@latest"]`
    - Environment variables:
      - `FASTMCP_LOG_LEVEL`: `ERROR`
      - `AWS_DOCUMENTATION_PARTITION`: `aws`
    - Set `disabled` to `false` and `autoApprove` to an empty list.

### Key Learnings & Insights

- **Streamlining Development Environment**:
  - The removal of unnecessary VS Code extensions aims to streamline the development environment, reducing clutter and potential conflicts.
  
- **Frequent Image Updates**:
  - The change in the ArgoCD image update interval from `6h` to `1h` indicates a need for more frequent updates, possibly due to rapid development cycles or dependency updates.

- **Integration of AWS Documentation**:
  - The addition of the `awslabs.aws-documentation-mcp-server` suggests an integration effort to include AWS documentation within the Open WebUI, enhancing the user experience by providing direct access to relevant documentation.

### Impact Assessment

- **Performance**:
  - More frequent image updates may slightly increase resource usage but ensure the system stays up-to-date with the latest changes.
  
- **Maintainability**:
  - Streamlining the development environment can lead to fewer conflicts and a more consistent developer experience.
  
- **User Experience**:
  - The integration of AWS documentation within the Open WebUI will likely improve user experience by providing immediate access to necessary documentation.

### Developer Notes

- **Gotchas**:
  - Ensure that the new interval for image updates does not conflict with other CI/CD pipelines or resource limitations.
  
- **Future Improvements**:
  - Consider adding more detailed logging or monitoring for the new AWS documentation server to ensure it operates correctly.
  - Evaluate the necessity of the retained `hashicorp.hcl` extension periodically to maintain a lean development environment.
