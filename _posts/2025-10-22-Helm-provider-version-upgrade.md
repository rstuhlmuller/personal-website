**Change Summary**
This change involves updating the Helm provider version from `~> 2.0` to `~> 3.0` across multiple Terraform configuration files within various modules and the production environment. This update affects the `argocd`, `external-secrets`, `longhorn`, `metallb`, `metrics`, `storage`, and `traefik` modules.

**Technical Details**
- **Files Modified:**
  - `IaC/modules/argocd/init.tf`
  - `IaC/modules/external-secrets/init.tf`
  - `IaC/modules/longhorn/init.tf`
  - `IaC/modules/metallb/init.tf`
  - `IaC/modules/metrics/init.tf`
  - `IaC/modules/storage/init.tf`
  - `IaC/modules/traefik/init.tf`
  - Corresponding `.terraform.lock.hcl` files in the `IaC/production/homelab` directory for each module.
- **Changes:**
  - Updated the Helm provider version constraint from `~> 2.0` to `~> 3.0`.
  - Updated the specific Helm provider version from `2.17.0` to `3.0.2` in the `.terraform.lock.hcl` files.
- **Dependencies:**
  - Ensures compatibility with the latest Helm features and bug fixes.

**Key Learnings & Insights**
- **Reasoning:** The upgrade to Helm `3.0` was necessary to leverage new features and improvements offered in the latest version, such as enhanced Helm templating, improved dependency management, and better support for Kubernetes resources.
- **Problem-Solving:** The change required a thorough review of each module to ensure that the updated Helm version does not introduce breaking changes or incompatibilities with existing configurations.
- **Best Practices:** Regularly updating dependencies to their latest versions helps in maintaining security, performance, and feature parity. However, it is crucial to test changes in a staging environment before deploying to production.

**Impact Assessment**
- **System Impact:** The update should not significantly impact the current system functionality, provided that all configurations are compatible with Helm `3.0`. However, it may introduce changes in how Helm charts are rendered and managed.
- **Performance:** Potential performance improvements due to optimizations in Helm `3.0`.
- **Security:** Enhanced security features and bug fixes included in the newer Helm version.
- **Breaking Changes:** Careful testing is required to ensure no breaking changes are introduced, especially in chart dependencies and templating.

**Developer Notes**
- **Gotchas:** Ensure that all Helm charts used within the modules are compatible with Helm `3.0`. Some charts may require updates to work correctly with the new version.
- **Edge Cases:** Pay attention to any custom scripts or CI/CD pipelines that might be affected by the Helm version change.
- **Future Improvements:** Consider automating the dependency update process to streamline future upgrades and reduce manual effort.
