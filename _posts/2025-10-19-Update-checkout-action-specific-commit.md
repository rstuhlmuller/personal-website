### Change Summary

This git diff reflects a minor but specific update to the GitHub Actions workflow file `release.yml`. The primary change is the update to a specific commit hash for the `actions/checkout` action, rather than using a version tag.

### Technical Details

- **File Modified:** `.github/workflows/release.yml`
- **Action Updated:** `actions/checkout`
  - **Previous Version:** `v4`
  - **New Version:** Specific commit hash `08eba0b27e820071cde6df949e0beb9ba4906955`

The change involves replacing the version tag `v4` with a specific commit hash for the `actions/checkout` action. This ensures that the workflow uses a fixed version of the action, which can be crucial for maintaining consistency across different runs of the workflow.

### Key Learnings & Insights

- **Version Pinning:** Using a specific commit hash instead of a version tag can help avoid unexpected changes due to new releases of the action. This is particularly important for critical workflows where stability is paramount.
- **Change Management:** This approach demonstrates a best practice in change management within CI/CD pipelinesâ€”pinning dependencies to specific versions or commits to ensure reproducibility.
- **Trade-offs:** While pinning to a specific commit provides stability, it also means that automatic updates to the action (which might include bug fixes or security patches) will be missed. Teams must balance stability with the need for updates.

### Impact Assessment

- **Stability:** This change enhances the stability of the release workflow by ensuring that the `actions/checkout` action does not change unexpectedly.
- **Maintenance:** Future maintenance might require manual updates to this commit hash if the underlying action receives critical updates or security patches.
- **No Breaking Changes:** There are no breaking changes introduced by this update. However, teams should be aware of the need for manual intervention if the pinned action needs to be updated.

### Developer Notes

- **Gotchas:** Be cautious when pinning to specific commits. Ensure that the commit is well-tested and does not contain known issues.
- **Future Improvements:** Consider implementing a process for regularly reviewing and updating pinned dependencies to benefit from improvements and security patches while maintaining control over when changes are introduced.
- **Context for Future Developers:** This change was made to ensure workflow stability. If updates to the `actions/checkout` action are required in the future, evaluate the changes carefully before updating the commit hash.
