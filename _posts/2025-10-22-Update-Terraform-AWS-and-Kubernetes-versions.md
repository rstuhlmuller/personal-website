### Change Summary
This git diff primarily focuses on updating Terraform provider versions across multiple modules and components within the `IaC` directory. Additionally, there are minor changes to configuration files and the addition of new settings in `renovate.json`.

### Technical Details
- **Configuration Update**: 
  - File: `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`
  - Change: Updated `TG_TF_FORWARD_STDOUT` from `true` to `"true"`. This change ensures the value is consistently treated as a string.
  
- **Terraform Provider Versions**:
  - Multiple files within `IaC/modules` and `IaC/production/homelab` have been updated to use newer versions of the `hashicorp/aws` and `hashicorp/kubernetes` providers.
  - The version of `hashicorp/aws` was updated from `~> 5.0` to `~> 6.0`.
  - The version of `hashicorp/kubernetes` was updated from `2.37.1` to `2.38.0`.
  - The version of `argoproj-labs/argocd` was updated from `7.8.0` to `7.11.2`.

- **Terraform Lock Files**:
  - Various `.terraform.lock.hcl` files were updated to reflect the new provider versions and their respective hashes.

- **Renovate Configuration**:
  - File: `renovate.json`
  - Change: Added `:rebaseStalePrs` and `group:allNonMajor` to the extends array. This configures Renovate to rebase stale pull requests and group all non-major dependency updates.

### Key Learnings & Insights
- **Consistency in Configuration**:
  - The change in `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` highlights the importance of consistent data types in configuration files to avoid potential runtime issues.
  
- **Version Management**:
  - Updating Terraform providers to newer versions ensures access to the latest features, bug fixes, and security patches. It also helps in maintaining compatibility with other dependencies and infrastructure components.
  
- **Automated Dependency Management**:
  - The updates to `renovate.json` demonstrate the use of tools like Renovate to automate dependency management, reducing manual effort and ensuring dependencies are kept up-to-date.

### Impact Assessment
- **Performance and Features**:
  - The updated Terraform providers may include performance improvements and new features that can enhance the overall infrastructure management.
  
- **Security**:
  - Newer versions of providers often contain security patches, which help in maintaining a secure environment.
  
- **Maintainability**:
  - Keeping dependencies up-to-date simplifies maintenance and reduces technical debt. It also ensures that the infrastructure code is compatible with the latest versions of cloud services.

### Developer Notes
- **Testing**:
  - Ensure to thoroughly test the infrastructure after applying these changes to verify that all resources are provisioned correctly and that there are no breaking changes.
  
- **Documentation**:
  - Update the documentation to reflect the new provider versions and any changes in behavior or features that may affect the deployment process.
  
- **Future Improvements**:
  - Consider setting up automated tests for Terraform configurations to catch any issues introduced by dependency updates.
  - Explore the possibility of using Terraform version constraints more effectively to balance between stability and receiving updates.
