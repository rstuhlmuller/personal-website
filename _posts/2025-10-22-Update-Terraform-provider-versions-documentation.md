### Change Summary
This git diff primarily reflects updates to Terraform provider versions across multiple modules and configurations within the `IaC` directory. The changes include upgrading the `aws` and `kubernetes` providers from versions `~> 5.0` to `~> 6.0` and from `2.37.1` to `2.38.0`, respectively. Additionally, the `argocd` provider version has been updated from `7.8.0` to `7.11.2`. A minor change was also made in the `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` file where a boolean value was changed from `true` to `"true"`. Lastly, the `renovate.json` file was updated to include new configuration options.

### Technical Details
- **.devcontainer/devcontainer.json**:
  - Changed `TG_TF_FORWARD_STDOUT` from `true` to `"true"`.
- **IaC/modules/{cert-manager,cloudflare-tunnel,homarr,tailscale}/init.tf**:
  - Updated `aws` provider version from `~> 5.0` to `~> 6.0`.
- **IaC/production/homelab/{argocd,cert-manager,cloudflare-tunnel,database,descheduler,external-secrets,homarr,litellm,longhorn,metallb,monitoring,n8n,octobot,open-webui,tailscale,technitium,traefik}/.terraform.lock.hcl**:
  - Updated `aws` provider version to `6.17.0`.
  - Updated `kubernetes` provider version to `2.38.0`.
  - Updated `argocd` provider version to `7.11.2`.
- **renovate.json**:
  - Added `:rebaseStalePrs` and `group:allNonMajor` to the extends array.

### Key Learnings & Insights
- **Version Management**: The updates to Terraform provider versions indicate a practice of keeping dependencies up-to-date to leverage new features, bug fixes, and security patches.
- **Configuration Consistency**: Ensuring that all modules use consistent provider versions helps maintain uniformity across the infrastructure code, reducing potential compatibility issues.
- **Renovate Configuration**: The addition of `:rebaseStalePrs` and `group:allNonMajor` in `renovate.json` suggests an effort to automate and streamline the dependency update process, making it more maintainable.

### Impact Assessment
- **Performance & Features**: Upgrading to newer versions of Terraform providers may introduce performance improvements and new features that can enhance the overall system.
- **Security**: Newer versions often include security patches, which is crucial for maintaining a secure infrastructure.
- **Maintainability**: Consistent provider versions across modules simplify maintenance and reduce the risk of version-specific bugs or issues.

### Developer Notes
- **Testing**: Ensure that all Terraform configurations are thoroughly tested post-upgrade to verify that the new provider versions do not introduce breaking changes.
- **Documentation**: Update any relevant documentation to reflect the new provider versions and their implications.
- **Future Improvements**: Consider implementing a version pinning strategy to better control updates and minimize unexpected changes.
