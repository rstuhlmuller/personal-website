### Change Summary
This commit introduces a new Terraform module for managing the "octobot" deployment within a Kubernetes cluster. The changes include the creation of new HCL files for configuration, the addition of Terraform provider specifications, and the definition of Kubernetes resources such as namespaces, ArgoCD applications, and TLS certificates.

### Technical Details
- **New Files Created:**
  - `IaC/_envcommon/locks/octobot.terraform.lock.hcl`
  - `IaC/_envcommon/octobot.hcl`
  - `IaC/modules/octobot/init.tf`
  - `IaC/modules/octobot/main.tf`
  - `IaC/modules/octobot/secrets.tf`
  - `IaC/production/homelab/octobot/.terraform.lock.hcl`
  - `IaC/production/homelab/octobot/terragrunt.hcl`

- **Configuration Changes:**
  - `octobot.hcl` includes references to `root.hcl`, `kube_provider.hcl`, and `argocd_provider.hcl`.
  - `init.tf` specifies required Terraform providers: `kubernetes` and `argocd`.
  - `main.tf` defines a Kubernetes namespace and an ArgoCD application for "octobot", including ingress configuration and TLS settings.
  - `secrets.tf` (commented out) would manage secrets for the deployment.

- **Provider Specifications:**
  - `init.tf` requires `kubernetes` provider version `~> 2.36` and `argocd` provider version `7.8.0`.

- **Resource Definitions:**
  - `main.tf` creates a Kubernetes namespace named "octobot".
  - `main.tf` also defines an ArgoCD application for "octobot" with specific source, destination, and sync policy configurations.
  - A TLS certificate resource is defined for securing the ingress.

### Key Learnings & Insights
- **Modular Terraform Setup:** The changes demonstrate a modular approach to Terraform configuration, separating common configurations from module-specific ones.
- **Provider Management:** Explicitly specifying provider versions ensures consistency and avoids unexpected behavior due to provider updates.
- **ArgoCD Integration:** The use of ArgoCD for application deployment showcases a GitOps approach, enabling automated, declarative management of Kubernetes applications.
- **Security Considerations:** The inclusion of a TLS certificate highlights the importance of securing application endpoints, though the secrets management section is currently commented out.

### Impact Assessment
- **System Enhancement:** These changes enhance the deployment process by introducing a structured, version-controlled approach to managing the "octobot" application within Kubernetes.
- **Maintainability:** The modular setup and explicit provider versions improve maintainability and reduce the risk of deployment issues.
- **Security:** The addition of a TLS certificate improves the security posture of the application by ensuring encrypted communication.

### Developer Notes
- **Provider Versions:** Ensure that the specified provider versions are compatible with the rest of the infrastructure.
- **Secrets Management:** Uncomment and configure the secrets management section carefully to avoid exposing sensitive information.
- **ArgoCD Sync Policy:** Monitor the automated sync policy to ensure it aligns with the desired deployment behavior, especially the `prune` and `self_heal` settings.
- **Future Improvements:** Consider automating the secrets management process further and exploring additional ArgoCD features for enhanced deployment strategies.
