### Change Summary
This update involves a minor cleanup in the Infrastructure as Code (IaC) module for n8n, specifically within the `main.tf` file. The primary change is the removal of a temporary comment (`// test`) from the configuration block of the `argocd_application` resource. No functional code was altered, added, or removed; this is purely a refactoring step to improve code cleanliness and maintainability.

### Technical Details
- **File Affected**: `IaC/modules/n8n/main.tf`
  - The change occurs in the `argocd_application` resource named "n8n", specifically within the `config` map.
  - Before the change: The config block included a stray comment `// test` immediately after the opening brace, like so:
    ```
    config = {
      // test
      n8n_editor_base_url = "https://n8n.stinkyboi.com"
      n8n_external_url    = "https://n8n.tail67beb.ts.net"
      webhook_url         = "https://n8n.tail67beb.ts.net"
    }
    ```
  - After the change: The comment is removed, resulting in a cleaner config map:
    ```
    config = {
      n8n_editor_base_url = "https://n8n.stinkyboi.com"
      n8n_external_url    = "https://n8n.tail67beb.ts.net"
      webhook_url         = "https://n8n.tail67beb.ts.net"
    }
    ```
- **Architectural/Design Changes**: This is a non-functional edit with no impact on the Terraform resource's behavior, ArgoCD application deployment, or n8n's runtime configuration. It adheres to Terraform's HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language) syntax, where comments are optional and do not affect parsing.
- **Dependencies and Configurations**: No changes to dependencies, variables, or environment settings. The config values (e.g., URLs for editor base, external, and webhook) remain unchanged and continue to point to custom domains, likely for a tailored n8n workflow automation setup.

### Key Learnings & Insights
- **Reasoning Behind the Change**: The `// test` comment was likely a temporary marker added during development or debugging phases to flag the config block for testing purposes. Removing it now indicates that the configuration has been validated and is ready for production, emphasizing the importance of code hygiene in IaC to prevent clutter that could confuse future maintainers.
- **Problem-Solving Approach**: This reflects a simple yet effective refactoring technique—scanning for and eliminating non-essential artifacts post-testing. It demonstrates iterative development where temporary notes are used for quick annotations but are promptly cleaned up to maintain a professional codebase.
- **Best Practices Demonstrated**: 
  - Follow the "leave no trace" principle in version control: Remove debugging remnants to keep the repository clean and focused on production-ready code.
  - Use meaningful comments sparingly; in this case, the removal avoids potential misinterpretation (e.g., someone mistaking "// test" for an active test directive).
- **Trade-offs/Decisions**: There was minimal risk in this removal since it's non-functional, but the decision prioritizes readability over retaining historical notes. If context was needed, it could have been moved to a commit message or external documentation instead.

### Impact Assessment
- **System-Wide Effects**: The change has zero functional impact on the n8n deployment via ArgoCD. The application will continue to deploy with the same storage (10Gi) and config URLs, ensuring seamless workflow automation without disruptions.
- **Performance, Security, and Maintainability**: No performance or security implications, as comments are ignored at runtime. Maintainability improves slightly by reducing visual noise, making the file easier to read and audit.
- **Breaking Changes or Migrations**: None—this is a backward-compatible cleanup. No migrations, updates to dependent modules, or redeployments are required.

### Developer Notes
- **Gotchas and Edge Cases**: Be cautious when removing comments in HCL; while harmless here, ensure they're not placeholders for actual code (e.g., commented-out configurations). In larger configs, use tools like `terraform fmt` to automatically clean and standardize formatting.
- **Context for Future Developers**: This module manages an n8n instance with ArgoCD, using custom URLs that might be tied to a specific environment (e.g., `stinkyboi.com` and `tail67beb.ts.net` suggest a Tailscale or custom DNS setup). If modifying configs, test URL changes thoroughly to avoid breaking webhooks or editor access.
- **Potential Improvements**: Consider adding inline documentation (e.g., comments explaining each config key) or migrating to a more structured config format like YAML for better readability. Future enhancements could include variable interpolation for URLs to make the module more reusable across environments.
