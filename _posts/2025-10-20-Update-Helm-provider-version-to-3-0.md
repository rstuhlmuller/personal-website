### Change Summary
This change updates the version of the `helm` provider across multiple Terraform modules from version `~> 2.0` to `~> 3.0`. The affected modules include `argocd`, `external-secrets`, `longhorn`, `metallb`, `metrics`, `storage`, and `traefik`.

### Technical Details
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `IaC/modules/argocd/init.tf`
  - `IaC/modules/external-secrets/init.tf`
  - `IaC/modules/longhorn/init.tf`
  - `IaC/modules/metallb/init.tf`
  - `IaC/modules/metrics/init.tf`
  - `IaC/modules/storage/init.tf`
  - `IaC/modules/traefik/init.tf`
  
- **Changes**: 
  - Updated the `helm` provider version from `~> 2.0` to `~> 3.0` in each module’s `init.tf` file.
  
- **Dependencies**: 
  - Ensure that all modules using the `helm` provider are compatible with version `3.0`.
  - Verify that there are no breaking changes in the `helm` provider that could affect the existing configurations.

### Key Learnings & Insights
- **Reasoning Behind Changes**: 
  - The update to `helm` version `3.0` is likely driven by the need to leverage new features, bug fixes, or security patches available in the newer version.
  
- **Problem-Solving Approaches**: 
  - A systematic approach was used to identify all modules dependent on the `helm` provider and update them uniformly to avoid version mismatches.
  
- **Best Practices**: 
  - Regularly updating dependencies to their latest versions helps in maintaining security and taking advantage of new features.
  - It’s crucial to test the changes in a staging environment before deploying to production to ensure compatibility and stability.

### Impact Assessment
- **Overall System**: 
  - The change should not introduce significant disruptions if the new `helm` version is backward-compatible. However, thorough testing is required to ensure all configurations work as expected.
  
- **Performance & Security**: 
  - Potential performance improvements and security enhancements from the updated `helm` provider.
  
- **Breaking Changes**: 
  - There might be breaking changes in the `helm` provider that could require additional modifications in the Terraform configurations. Review the `helm` provider release notes for any such changes.

### Developer Notes
- **Gotchas**: 
  - Be aware of any deprecated features or changed behaviors in the `helm` provider version `3.0`.
  - Ensure that all Helm charts used in these modules are compatible with the new provider version.
  
- **Future Improvements**: 
  - Consider automating the dependency update process to streamline future updates.
  - Implement version pinning strategies to better control dependency updates and minimize risks.
