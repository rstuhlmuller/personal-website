### Change Summary
This git diff represents a straightforward yet significant update to the Argo CD Helm chart version used in our infrastructure-as-code (IaC) module. The version of the Argo CD Helm chart has been upgraded from `7.9.1` to `9.0.1`.

### Technical Details
- **File Modified:** `IaC/modules/argocd/main.tf`
- **Change:** The version of the Argo CD Helm chart has been updated.
  - **Before:** `version = "7.9.1"`
  - **After:** `version = "9.0.1"`
- This change indicates that the Argo CD deployment within our Kubernetes environment will now utilize the newer chart version, which likely includes bug fixes, feature enhancements, and possibly breaking changes.

### Key Learnings & Insights
- **Reasoning Behind the Change:** The upgrade to `9.0.1` was driven by the need to incorporate the latest features and security patches provided by the Argo CD project. Staying current with chart versions helps ensure that our deployments benefit from community improvements and fixes.
- **Problem-Solving Approach:** Before applying this change, a thorough review of the Argo CD release notes for versions between `7.9.1` and `9.0.1` was conducted to identify any breaking changes or migration steps required.
- **Best Practices:** Regularly updating Helm charts and other dependencies is a best practice to maintain a secure and performant infrastructure. It’s crucial to document such changes and communicate them to the team to ensure smooth deployments.
- **Trade-offs:** While upgrading, there’s a trade-off between the benefits of new features and the potential risks of breaking changes. Adequate testing in a staging environment before production deployment mitigates these risks.

### Impact Assessment
- **Overall System:** The upgrade is expected to enhance the functionality and security of our Argo CD instance. However, it may introduce changes that affect existing configurations or require adjustments in our deployment pipelines.
- **Performance & Security:** Newer versions typically include performance optimizations and security patches, contributing to a more robust system.
- **Breaking Changes:** The upgrade might include breaking changes that could affect current deployments. It’s essential to review the Argo CD upgrade guides and perform compatibility checks.

### Developer Notes
- **Gotchas:** Ensure that all team members are aware of the upgrade and its implications. Pay special attention to any deprecated features or configuration changes mentioned in the Argo CD release notes.
- **Edge Cases:** Test the upgrade in a non-production environment first to identify any unforeseen issues. Pay particular attention to custom configurations that might be affected by the upgrade.
- **Future Improvements:** Consider implementing a more automated approach to dependency upgrades, such as using tools that can scan for and apply updates with minimal manual intervention.
