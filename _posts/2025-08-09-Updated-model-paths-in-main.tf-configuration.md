### Change Summary
This git diff reflects updates to the `main.tf` file within the `litellm` module of the Infrastructure as Code (IaC) repository. Specifically, the changes involve updating the model endpoints for two machine learning models: "Nova Pro" and "DeepSeek-R1". 

### Technical Details
- **File Modified**: `IaC/modules/litellm/main.tf`
- **Changes**:
  - Updated the `model` parameter for the "Nova Pro" model from `bedrock/amazon.nova-pro-v1:0` to `bedrock/us.amazon.nova-pro-v1:0`.
  - Updated the `model` parameter for the "DeepSeek-R1" model from `bedrock/converse/deepseek.r1-v1:0` to `bedrock/us.deepseek.r1-v1:0`.
- These changes were made within the `argocd_application` resource configuration for the `litellm` application.
- The `aws_region_name` remains unchanged at `us-west-2`.

### Key Learnings & Insights
- **Reasoning Behind Changes**: The endpoint updates likely reflect a change in the hosting or regional availability of the machine learning models. This could be due to improvements in service offerings, regional expansions, or adjustments in the underlying infrastructure.
- **Problem-Solving Approach**: The changes indicate a need to keep the configuration files up-to-date with the current service endpoints to ensure the application functions correctly.
- **Best Practices**: Regularly reviewing and updating configuration files to align with service changes is a best practice for maintaining robust and reliable infrastructure.
- **Trade-offs**: While these changes are relatively minor, they underscore the importance of monitoring service announcements and updates from cloud providers to avoid disruptions.

### Impact Assessment
- **System Impact**: These changes should not significantly impact the overall system, assuming the new endpoints are correctly configured and operational. 
- **Performance**: There should be no performance degradation, provided the new endpoints are properly set up.
- **Security**: No immediate security implications are apparent, but itâ€™s always good practice to verify that the new endpoints are secure and compliant with organizational standards.
- **Maintainability**: Keeping endpoint configurations up-to-date enhances maintainability by ensuring the infrastructure aligns with the latest service offerings.

### Developer Notes
- **Gotchas**: Ensure that the new endpoints are valid and operational before deploying these changes. 
- **Edge Cases**: Consider scenarios where the new endpoints might not be available in all regions or might have different latency characteristics.
- **Future Improvements**: Regularly audit endpoint configurations to align with cloud provider updates. Automate where possible to reduce manual oversight.
