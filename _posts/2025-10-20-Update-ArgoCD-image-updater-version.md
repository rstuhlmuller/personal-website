### Change Summary:
This git diff reflects a single but significant change in the `main.tf` file within the ArgoCD module. Specifically, the version of the `argocd-image-updater` Helm chart has been updated from `0.12.3` to `0.13.0`.

### Technical Details:
- **File Modified:** `IaC/modules/argocd/main.tf`
- **Change:** 
  - The version of the `argocd-image-updater` Helm chart has been updated.
  - Old version: `0.12.3`
  - New version: `0.13.0`
- **Helm Release Configuration:**
  ```hcl
  resource "helm_release" "argocd_image_updater" {
    name       = "argocd-image-updater"
    chart      = "argocd-image-updater"
    repository = "https://argoproj.github.io/argo-helm"
    - version    = "0.12.3"
    + version    = "0.13.0"
    namespace  = kubernetes_namespace.argocd.metadata[0].name
    wait       = true
  }
  ```

### Key Learnings & Insights:
- **Reasoning Behind the Change:** 
  - The update to version `0.13.0` likely includes bug fixes, new features, or security patches that were not present in version `0.12.3`. Keeping dependencies up-to-date is a best practice to ensure the system benefits from the latest improvements and security enhancements.
- **Problem-Solving Approach:** 
  - The change was straightforward, involving a simple version bump. However, it’s important to verify the release notes of the new version to understand any breaking changes or new configurations required.
- **Best Practices Demonstrated:**
  - Regularly updating dependencies to their latest versions helps maintain a secure and performant system.
  - Using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like Terraform ensures that changes are version-controlled and easily auditable.

### Impact Assessment:
- **Overall System Effect:** 
  - The update should introduce improvements or fixes without significant disruption, assuming there are no breaking changes in the new Helm chart version.
- **Performance & Security:** 
  - Potential performance improvements or security patches included in `0.13.0` could positively impact the system.
- **Breaking Changes:** 
  - It’s crucial to review the release notes for version `0.13.0` to identify any breaking changes that might require additional configuration adjustments or migration steps.

### Developer Notes:
- **Gotchas & Edge Cases:**
  - Ensure that the new version `0.13.0` is compatible with the existing ArgoCD setup and other dependencies.
  - Verify if there are any new configuration options or required settings introduced in `0.13.0`.
- **Future Improvements:**
  - Consider implementing a CI/CD pipeline step to automatically check for and apply updates to Helm chart versions, ensuring the system remains up-to-date with minimal manual intervention.
- **Context for Future Developers:**
  - Document the reasoning behind version updates and any associated configurations or dependencies in the project’s README or wiki to provide context for future changes.
