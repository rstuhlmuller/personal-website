### Change Summary
This git diff includes modifications to the development container configuration and updates to Terraform modules for ArgoCD and Open WebUI. The changes primarily involve removing unnecessary VSCode extensions, adjusting the interval for an ArgoCD image updater, and adding a new AWS documentation MCP server to the Open WebUI module.

### Technical Details
- **Development Container Configuration (`.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`):**
  - Removed the following VSCode extensions:
    - `hashicorp.terraform`
    - `GitHub.copilot`
    - `GitHub.copilot-chat`
    - `eamodio.gitlens`
  - Retained `hashicorp.hcl` and `hashicorp.terraform`.

- **ArgoCD Module (`IaC/modules/argocd/main.tf`):**
  - Modified the `helm_release` resource for `argocd_image_updater`:
    - Changed the interval from `6h` to `1h` for more frequent image updates.

- **Open WebUI Module (`IaC/modules/open-webui/main.tf`):**
  - Added a new configuration for `awslabs.aws-documentation-mcp-server`:
    - Command: `uvx`
    - Arguments: `["awslabs.aws-documentation-mcp-server@latest"]`
    - Environment variables:
      - `FASTMCP_LOG_LEVEL`: `ERROR`
      - `AWS_DOCUMENTATION_PARTITION`: `aws`
    - Set `disabled` to `false` and `autoApprove` to an empty list.

### Key Learnings & Insights
- **Streamlining Development Environment:** 
  - Removing unnecessary VSCode extensions helps streamline the development environment, reducing clutter and potential conflicts.
- **Frequent Updates for ArgoCD:**
  - Reducing the update interval for the ArgoCD image updater from `6h` to `1h` ensures more timely updates, which can be critical for security and feature updates.
- **Integration of New Services:**
  - Adding the `awslabs.aws-documentation-mcp-server` to the Open WebUI module demonstrates the integration of new services to enhance functionality. This change required careful configuration of environment variables and command arguments to ensure proper operation.

### Impact Assessment
- **Performance:** 
  - More frequent ArgoCD image updates may slightly increase resource usage but are likely negligible given the nature of the task.
- **Security:** 
  - Timely updates enhance security by applying patches and fixes more promptly.
- **Maintainability:** 
  - Streamlining the development environment and adding well-configured new services improve maintainability by reducing complexity and enhancing functionality.

### Developer Notes
- **Gotchas:**
  - Ensure that the new interval for ArgoCD image updates does not conflict with other scheduled tasks.
- **Environment Variables:**
  - Pay attention to the environment variables set for the `awslabs.aws-documentation-mcp-server` to avoid logging issues or partition misconfigurations.
- **Future Improvements:**
  - Consider automating the extension management in the development container to further streamline the setup process.
  - Explore additional configurations or optimizations for the newly added AWS documentation server to enhance performance and logging.
