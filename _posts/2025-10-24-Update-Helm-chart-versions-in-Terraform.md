### Change Summary
This git diff reflects updates to the Helm chart versions for two key components in our infrastructure-as-code (IaC) setup: Argo CD and External Secrets. Specifically, the Argo CD Helm chart has been updated from version 9.0.3 to 9.0.5, and the External Secrets Helm chart has been updated from version 0.20.3 to 0.20.4.

### Technical Details
- **Argo CD Update**:
  - File: `IaC/modules/argocd/main.tf`
  - Change: Updated the `version` attribute of the `helm_release` resource from `9.0.3` to `9.0.5`.
  - This update ensures that the Argo CD deployment utilizes the latest features and bug fixes available in version 9.0.5.
  
- **External Secrets Update**:
  - File: `IaC/modules/external-secrets/main.tf`
  - Change: Updated the `version` attribute of the `helm_release` resource from `0.20.3` to `0.20.4`.
  - This modification aligns the External Secrets deployment with the newest version, incorporating recent enhancements and security patches.

### Key Learnings & Insights
- **Importance of Regular Updates**:
  - Keeping Helm charts up-to-date is crucial for leveraging the latest improvements and security fixes.
