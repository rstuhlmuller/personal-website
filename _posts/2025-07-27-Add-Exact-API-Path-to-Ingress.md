### Change Summary
This update modifies the Kubernetes Ingress configuration in the monitoring module to add a new exact path routing for the "/api/send" endpoint. The change exposes this specific API path to the "umami" service on port 3000, likely to enable targeted external access for data submission or event tracking in an Umami analytics setup. No files were added or removed; the modification is isolated to the existing `main.tf` file in the IaC/modules/monitoring directory.

### Technical Details
- **File Affected**: `IaC/modules/monitoring/main.tf`
  - The change occurs within the `kubernetes_ingress_v1` resource block named "umami_tailscale_funnel".
  - A new `path` block is inserted at line 192 (post-diff), adding support for the "/api/send" route:
    - `path` is set to "/api/send" with `path_type` as "Exact" to ensure precise matching without prefix or regex behavior.
    - The `backend` configures routing to the "umami" service on port 3000, which is likely the default port for Umami's Next.js-based application.
- **Architectural Changes**: This enhances the Ingress resource, which acts as an API gateway in Kubernetes, by extending its routing rules. It follows Kubernetes Ingress v1 specifications, integrating with Tailscale (implied by the resource name) for secure, funnel-based external access.
- **Dependencies and Configurations**: No new dependencies are introduced. This assumes an existing "umami" service deployment in the cluster and relies on Tailscale for ingress traffic tunneling. The TLS block (partially shown in the diff) remains unchanged, suggesting certificate management is already handled for secure connections.

### Key Learnings & Insights
- **Reasoning Behind Changes**: The addition targets a specific Umami API endpoint (/api/send), which is commonly used for submitting analytics events or telemetry data. This could be driven by a need to allow external clients (e.g., mobile apps or scripts) to send data directly without exposing the entire Umami application, improving modularity and security.
- **Problem-Solving Approach**: By using an "Exact" path type, the change avoids unintended routing overlaps with other paths, demonstrating a precise configuration to handle API-specific traffic. This reflects iterative IaC refinement, where monitoring setups evolve to support new features without overhauling the entire ingress.
- **Best Practices Demonstrated**: Adheres to least-privilege access by routing only the necessary path; promotes Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles using Terraform for declarative, version-controlled changes. Lessons learned include the importance of path specificity in Ingress to prevent routing conflicts in multi-service environments.
- **Trade-offs**: Opting for exact matching ensures precision but might require additional paths for related endpoints in the future. This was likely chosen over a prefix match to minimize exposure, trading flexibility for security.

### Impact Assessment
- **System-Wide Effects**: The change enables external traffic to reach the "/api/send" endpoint via the Tailscale funnel, potentially increasing data ingestion capabilities in the monitoring stack. It integrates seamlessly with existing Umami deployments without disrupting other routes.
- **Performance and Security Implications**: Minimal performance overhead, as it's just an additional routing rule; however, it could introduce security risks if not rate-limited, as it exposes an API for data submission—ensure Tailscale's access controls are configured to restrict origins. Maintainability improves by keeping configurations modular.
- **Breaking Changes or Migrations**: No breaking changes, as this is an additive update. Existing traffic remains unaffected, but deployments using this module will need a Terraform apply to propagate the new Ingress spec—no manual migrations required.

### Developer Notes
- **Gotchas and Edge Cases**: Watch for path conflicts if future updates add similar routes; test with tools like `kubectl describe ingress` to verify routing. Edge cases include high-traffic scenarios on "/api/send," which might overwhelm the Umami service—consider adding Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler.
- **Context for Future Developers**: This setup assumes Umami is running as a service in the same namespace; if namespaces differ, update the backend accordingly. The Tailscale funnel implies a zero-trust networking model—review Tailscale docs for authentication tweaks.
- **Potential Improvements**: Explore adding annotations for rate limiting (e.g., via Nginx Ingress Controller) or integrating Prometheus metrics for this path's traffic monitoring. Consider parametrizing paths in the Terraform module for easier extensibility in multi-tenant setups.
