### Change Summary
This git diff reflects an update across multiple Terraform configuration files within various modules and environments. The primary change is the upgrade of the `helm` provider from version `~> 2.0` to `~> 3.0` in all affected files. Additionally, the `.terraform.lock.hcl` files have been updated to reflect the new provider version.

### Technical Details
- **Files Modified:**
  - `IaC/modules/*/init.tf`
  - `IaC/production/homelab/*/.terraform.lock.hcl`
- **Changes:**
  - Updated the `helm` provider version from `~> 2.0` to `~> 3.0` in the `init.tf` files.
  - Modified the `.terraform.lock.hcl` files to include the new version `3.0.2` of the `helm` provider along with its hashes.

### Key Learnings & Insights
- **Reasoning Behind Changes:**
  - The upgrade to Helm version 3 is likely driven by the need to access new features, improvements, or bug fixes available in the latest version.
  - Ensuring compatibility and taking advantage of the latest provider capabilities can lead to more efficient and robust infrastructure management.
- **Problem-Solving Approach:**
  - A systematic approach was used to update the provider version across all relevant configuration files.
  - The use of version constraints (`~> 3.0`) ensures compatibility with minor version updates within the major version 3 series.

### Impact Assessment
- **Overall System Impact:**
  - The upgrade should enhance the functionality and reliability of Helm-based deployments within the Terraform configurations.
- **Performance and Security:**
  - Potential performance improvements and security patches included in Helm 3.0 may positively impact the infrastructure.
- **Breaking Changes:**
  - Developers should review Helm 3.0 release notes for any breaking changes that may require additional modifications to the Terraform configurations.

### Developer Notes
- **Gotchas and Edge Cases:**
  - Ensure that all Helm charts used in the configurations are compatible with Helm 3.0.
  - Test the updated configurations in a staging environment before deploying to production to identify any potential issues.
- **Future Improvements:**
  - Consider automating the provider version updates using tools or scripts to streamline future upgrades.
  - Regularly review and update provider versions to keep the infrastructure up-to-date with the latest features and security patches.
