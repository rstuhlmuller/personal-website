### Change Summary
This git diff introduces a new configuration file, `renovate.json`, which is used to configure the Renovate bot. Renovate is an automated dependency update tool that helps keep your project dependencies up to date. The addition of this file signifies the integration of Renovate into the project to streamline dependency management.

### Technical Details
- **File Added:** `renovate.json`
- **Configuration Schema:** The file adheres to the Renovate schema, as indicated by the `$schema` property pointing to `https://docs.renovatebot.com/renovate-schema.json`.
- **Extends Configuration:** The `extends` property is set to `[":semanticCommits"]`, which means that Renovate will generate semantic commits for any dependency updates it makes. Semantic commits follow a conventional commit format, making it easier to understand the nature of changes at a glance.

### Key Learnings & Insights
- **Automation of Dependency Management:** By integrating Renovate, the project automates the process of keeping dependencies up to date, reducing the manual effort required to manage versions.
- **Semantic Commits:** Using semantic commits enhances codebase maintainability by providing clear, descriptive commit messages that align with the project’s versioning strategy.
- **Best Practice:** Adopting tools like Renovate is a best practice in modern software development, ensuring that projects remain secure and performant by leveraging the latest dependency updates.

### Impact Assessment
- **Maintenance:** The introduction of Renovate simplifies dependency management, allowing developers to focus on feature development rather than manual version updates.
- **Performance & Security:** Regularly updating dependencies can lead to performance improvements and security enhancements, as newer versions often include bug fixes and security patches.
- **Breaking Changes:** While Renovate aims to make safe updates, there is a potential for breaking changes if a dependency update includes breaking changes. It is crucial to have robust testing in place to catch any issues introduced by dependency updates.

### Developer Notes
- **Monitoring:** Developers should monitor Renovate’s pull requests to ensure that updates align with the project’s requirements and do not introduce breaking changes.
- **Testing:** Comprehensive testing, including unit tests and integration tests, is essential to validate the impact of dependency updates.
- **Future Improvements:** Consider extending the Renovate configuration to include additional rules, such as specifying allowed update types (e.g., minor, patch) or configuring auto-merge for non-breaking changes.
