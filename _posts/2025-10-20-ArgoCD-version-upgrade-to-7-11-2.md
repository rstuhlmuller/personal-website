### Change Summary
This update involves a consistent change across multiple Terraform configuration files within the `IaC/modules` directory. Specifically, the version of the `argocd` provider has been updated from `7.8.0` to `7.11.2` in all relevant modules.

### Technical Details
- **Files Modified:** 
  - `IaC/modules/cert-manager/init.tf`
  - `IaC/modules/cloudflare-tunnel/init.tf`
  - `IaC/modules/database/init.tf`
  - `IaC/modules/descheduler/init.tf`
  - `IaC/modules/homarr/init.tf`
  - `IaC/modules/homeassistant/init.tf`
  - `IaC/modules/litellm/init.tf`
  - `IaC/modules/monitoring/init.tf`
  - `IaC/modules/n8n/init.tf`
  - `IaC/modules/octobot/init.tf`
  - `IaC/modules/open-webui/init.tf`
  - `IaC/modules/tailscale/init.tf`
  - `IaC/modules/technitium/init.tf`

- **Change Implemented:**
  - Updated the `argocd` provider version from `7.8.0` to `7.11.2` in the `required_providers` block of each `init.tf` file.

### Key Learnings & Insights
- **Reasoning Behind the Change:**
  - The update to `argocd` version `7.11.2` likely includes bug fixes, performance improvements, and new features that are beneficial for the overall system. Keeping dependencies up-to-date is a best practice to ensure security patches and enhancements are applied.
  
- **Problem-Solving Approach:**
  - A systematic approach was used to identify all modules dependent on the `argocd` provider and update them uniformly. This ensures consistency across the infrastructure-as-code (IaC) configurations.

- **Best Practices Demonstrated:**
  - Version management of dependencies to maintain system reliability and security.
  - Uniform updates across all relevant modules to avoid configuration drift.

### Impact Assessment
- **Overall System Effect:**
  - The update should enhance the stability and functionality of the Argo CD integrations within the system. It may also introduce new capabilities or improvements provided by the newer version.

- **Performance, Security, and Maintainability:**
  - **Performance:** Potential performance improvements from the newer version.
  - **Security:** Likely includes security patches from the older version.
  - **Maintainability:** Simplifies future updates by ensuring all modules use the same version.

- **Breaking Changes or Migration Requirements:**
  - There are no immediate breaking changes expected, but it is advisable to review the Argo CD release notes for any migration steps or deprecated features.

### Developer Notes
- **Gotchas and Edge Cases:**
  - Ensure that all environments (development, staging, production) are updated to the new version to avoid inconsistencies.
  - Verify that the new version of Argo CD is compatible with other dependencies and configurations in use.

- **Context for Future Developers:**
  - This change was made to leverage the latest features and fixes in Argo CD. Future updates should follow a similar approach to maintain uniformity.

- **Potential Future Improvements:**
  - Consider implementing a version management strategy that automates dependency updates across modules to reduce manual effort and error.
