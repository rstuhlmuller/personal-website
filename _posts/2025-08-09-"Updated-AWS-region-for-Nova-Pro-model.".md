### Change Summary
This update modifies the AWS region configuration for the `litellm` module within the Infrastructure as Code (IaC) setup. Specifically, the AWS region for the `litellm` service has been changed from `us-east-1` to `us-west-2`.

### Technical Details
- **File Modified:** `IaC/modules/litellm/main.tf`
- **Change Made:** 
  - The `aws_region_name` parameter within the `litellm_params` block of the `argocd_application` resource has been updated.
  - Original: `aws_region_name = "us-east-1"`
  - Updated: `aws_region_name = "us-west-2"`
- **Resource Affected:** `argocd_application` named `litellm`
- **Configuration Change:** 
  - The AWS region for deploying the `litellm` service has been switched, which may affect latency, cost, and availability based on the new region's characteristics.

### Key Learnings & Insights
- **Reasoning Behind the Change:** 
  - The shift from `us-east-1` to `us-west-2` could be due to various factors such as cost optimization, performance improvements in the new region, or compliance requirements.
- **Problem-Solving Approach:**
  - This change demonstrates a strategic decision to align the deployment region with business or technical requirements, showcasing the flexibility of IaC in accommodating such changes.
- **Best Practices:**
  - Always validate the impact of region changes on application performance and cost.
  - Ensure that all dependent services and resources are compatible with the new region.
- **Trade-offs:**
  - Changing regions might introduce latency for users in different geographic locations.
  - There might be cost implications depending on the AWS pricing model for different regions.

### Impact Assessment
- **System-wide Effects:**
  - The change will affect all components reliant on the `litellm` service, necessitating a review of inter-service communication patterns.
- **Performance:**
  - Potential changes in latency and response times for users based on their proximity to the `us-west-2` region.
- **Security:**
  - Ensure that the new region complies with the organizationâ€™s security policies and regulations.
- **Maintainability:**
  - Simplifies region-specific configurations, making the IaC more modular and easier to manage.

### Developer Notes
- **Gotchas:**
  - Verify that all resources and services interacting with `litellm` are available in the `us-west-2` region.
  - Check for any region-specific configurations or limitations that might affect the deployment.
- **Future Improvements:**
  - Consider implementing region failover mechanisms to enhance resilience.
  - Explore multi-region deployments for better global performance and redundancy.
