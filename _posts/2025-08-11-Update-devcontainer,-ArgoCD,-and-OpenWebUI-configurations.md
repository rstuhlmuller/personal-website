### Change Summary

This git diff encompasses several modifications across different files, primarily focusing on the development environment and infrastructure-as-code (IaC) configurations. The changes include updates to the development container configuration, adjustments to the ArgoCD module for image updates, and the addition of a new AWS documentation microservice in the Open WebUI module.

### Technical Details

#### Development Container Configuration
- **File:** `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`
  - **Change:** Removed several VS Code extensions (`hashicorp.terraform`, `GitHub.copilot`, `GitHub.copilot-chat`, `eamodio.gitlens`), retaining only `hashicorp.hcl` and `hashicorp.terraform`.
  - **Reason:** Streamlining the development environment by removing unnecessary extensions, likely to reduce clutter and improve load times.

#### ArgoCD Image Updater
- **File:** `IaC/modules/argocd/main.tf`
  - **Change:** Modified the interval for the ArgoCD image updater from `6h` to `1h`.
  - **Reason:** This change likely aims to ensure more frequent updates of container images, potentially improving security and feature parity by reducing the time between updates.

#### Open WebUI Module
- **File:** `IaC/modules/open-webui/main.tf`
  - **Change:** Added a new AWS documentation microservice configuration.
    - **Command:** `uvx`
    - **Arguments:** `["awslabs.aws-documentation-mcp-server@latest"]`
    - **Environment Variables:**
      - `FASTMCP_LOG_LEVEL`: `ERROR`
      - `AWS_DOCUMENTATION_PARTITION`: `aws`
    - **Disabled:** `false`
    - **Auto Approve:** `[]`
  - **Reason:** Integration of a new microservice to enhance the functionality of the Open WebUI, specifically for AWS documentation.

### Key Learnings & Insights

- **Streamlining Development Environments:** Removing unused extensions helps maintain a clean and efficient development environment.
- **Frequent Updates for Security:** Reducing the update interval for container images enhances security by ensuring that the latest patches and features are applied more promptly.
- **Microservice Integration:** Adding new microservices can extend the capabilities of existing applications, providing more value to users.

### Impact Assessment

- **Performance:** The changes to the development environment should result in faster load times for the development container. More frequent image updates may slightly increase resource usage due to more frequent pull operations.
- **Security:** More frequent image updates enhance security by reducing the window of exposure to vulnerabilities.
- **Maintainability:** The addition of a new microservice increases the complexity of the system, requiring careful management and monitoring to ensure stability and performance.

### Developer Notes

- **Gotchas:** Ensure that the new interval for image updates does not overwhelm the system with too many concurrent update operations.
- **Edge Cases:** Monitor the new AWS documentation microservice for any unexpected behavior or performance issues, especially under load.
- **Future Improvements:** Consider automating the process of removing unused VS Code extensions to further streamline the development environment. Additionally, explore options for dynamically adjusting the update interval based on system load or other metrics.
