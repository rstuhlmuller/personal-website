### Change Summary
This git diff reflects a minor but significant update to the GitHub Actions workflow file `release.yml`. The primary change is the update of the `actions/checkout` action from a specific version (`v4`) to a commit hash (`08eba0b27e820071cde6df949e0beb9ba4906955`).

### Technical Details
- **File Modified:** `.github/workflows/release.yml`
- **Change:** 
  - The `actions/checkout` action was updated from version `v4` to a specific commit hash `08eba0b27e820071cde6df949e0beb9ba4906955`.
  - This change was made within the `steps` section of the `release` job.

### Key Learnings & Insights
- **Reasoning Behind the Change:** 
  - Pinning to a specific commit hash instead of a version tag ensures that the workflow uses a known, stable state of the `actions/checkout` action. This can prevent potential issues that might arise from future updates to the `v4` tag.
- **Problem-Solving Approach:** 
  - The team likely encountered an issue or inconsistency with the latest `v4` release, prompting a switch to a specific commit to ensure reproducibility and stability.
- **Best Practices:** 
  - Using specific commit hashes for actions in CI/CD pipelines is a best practice for maintaining consistency across different runs, especially in critical release workflows.
- **Trade-offs:** 
  - While pinning to a commit hash provides stability, it also means that the workflow wonâ€™t automatically benefit from future improvements or bug fixes in the `actions/checkout` action unless manually updated.

### Impact Assessment
- **System Impact:** 
  - This change ensures that the release workflow remains consistent and reliable, reducing the risk of failures due to updates in the `actions/checkout` action.
- **Performance & Security:** 
  - There should be no negative performance or security implications from this change. However, the workflow will not automatically receive security patches unless updated manually.
- **Breaking Changes:** 
  - None. This is a non-breaking change aimed at stabilizing the release process.

### Developer Notes
- **Gotchas:** 
  - Remember that the workflow is now tied to a specific commit of the `actions/checkout` action. Any future updates to this action will require manually updating the commit hash.
- **Future Improvements:** 
  - Consider setting up a process to regularly review and update the pinned actions to ensure they are up-to-date with security patches and improvements.
- **Context for Future Developers:** 
  - This change was made to ensure workflow stability. If issues arise with the pinned commit, evaluate whether updating to a newer version or commit is necessary.
