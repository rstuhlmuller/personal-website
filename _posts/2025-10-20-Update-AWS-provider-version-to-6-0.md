### Change Summary
This change updates the version of the `hashicorp/aws` provider across multiple modules in the Infrastructure as Code (IaC) repository. Specifically, the version has been updated from `~> 5.0` to `~> 6.0` in the `cert-manager`, `cloudflare-tunnel`, `homarr`, and `tailscale` modules.

### Technical Details
- **Files Modified:**
  - `IaC/modules/cert-manager/init.tf`
  - `IaC/modules/cloudflare-tunnel/init.tf`
  - `IaC/modules/homarr/init.tf`
  - `IaC/modules/tailscale/init.tf`

- **Changes per File:**
  - In each file, the `version` attribute of the `aws` provider block was updated from `~> 5.0` to `~> 6.0`.

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~> 6.0"  // Updated from "~> 5.0"
    }
  }
}
```

- **Dependencies:**
  - This change requires that the `hashicorp/aws` provider version `6.0` or higher be available and compatible with the existing Terraform configuration.

### Key Learnings & Insights
- **Reasoning Behind the Changes:**
  - The update to `hashicorp/aws` version `6.0` likely includes new features, bug fixes, and improvements over version `5.0`. Keeping dependencies up-to-date is a best practice to ensure the infrastructure benefits from the latest enhancements and security patches.

- **Problem-Solving Approaches:**
  - A systematic approach was used to identify all modules dependent on the `hashicorp/aws` provider and update them uniformly. This ensures consistency across the IaC repository.

- **Best Practices Demonstrated:**
  - Version pinning with `~>`: Using the `~>` operator allows for non-breaking updates within the major version, balancing flexibility with stability.
  - Consistency in dependency management: Ensuring all modules use the same provider version avoids potential conflicts and simplifies maintenance.

### Impact Assessment
- **Overall System Impact:**
  - The update should introduce improvements and fixes without breaking changes, assuming backward compatibility is maintained by the provider.
  
- **Performance, Security, and Maintainability:**
  - **Performance:** Potential performance improvements from the new provider version.
  - **Security:** Enhanced security features or fixes included in the updated provider.
  - **Maintainability:** Simplified maintenance by using the latest provider version, reducing technical debt.

- **Breaking Changes or Migration Requirements:**
  - If the new provider version introduces breaking changes, additional migration steps may be required. It’s essential to review the provider’s release notes and test the changes in a staging environment before deploying to production.

### Developer Notes
- **Gotchas and Edge Cases:**
  - Ensure all team members are aware of the update and test their configurations thoroughly.
  - Check for any deprecated features or changed behaviors in the new provider version.

- **Context for Future Developers:**
  - Document the rationale for updating the provider version and any encountered issues during the upgrade process.
  - Maintain a changelog for provider versions to track updates and their impacts.

- **Potential Future Improvements:**
  - Consider automating the dependency update process to streamline future upgrades.
  - Implement continuous integration checks to validate provider version compatibility with the existing configuration.
