### Change Summary
This update involves several key changes primarily focused on updating Terraform provider versions across multiple modules and configurations within the IaC (Infrastructure as Code) directory. Additionally, there is a minor change in the `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` file and an update to the `renovate.json` configuration. The Terraform provider versions for `aws`, `kubernetes`, and `argocd` have been upgraded to ensure the project utilizes the latest features and security patches.

### Technical Details
- **.devcontainer/devcontainer.json**: 
  - Changed the value of `TG_TF_FORWARD_STDOUT` from `true` (boolean) to `"true"` (string). This might be to ensure consistency in environment variable types or to fix a bug where the boolean value was not being interpreted correctly.
  
- **IaC/modules/*/init.tf**: 
  - Updated the `aws` provider version from `~> 5.0` to `~> 6.0` in multiple files:
    - `cert-manager/init.tf`
    - `cloudflare-tunnel/init.tf`
    - `homarr/init.tf`
    - `tailscale/init.tf`
  
- **IaC/production/homelab/*/.terraform.lock.hcl**: 
  - Updated the `aws` provider version to `6.17.0` across various modules:
    - `argocd`
    - `cert-manager`
    - `cloudflare-tunnel`
    - `database`
    - `descheduler`
    - `external-secrets`
    - `homarr`
    - `homeassistant`
    - `litellm`
    - `longhorn`
    - `monitoring`
    - `n8n`
    - `octobot`
    - `open-webui`
    - `tailscale`
    - `technitium`
  - Updated the `kubernetes` provider version to `2.38.0` in multiple modules.
  - Updated the `argocd` provider version to `7.11.2` in several modules.

- **renovate.json**: 
  - Added `":rebaseStalePrs"` and `"group:allNonMajor"` to the extends array. This configures Renovate to rebase stale pull requests and group all non-major dependency updates together.

### Key Learnings & Insights
- **Version Consistency**: 
  - The changes demonstrate the importance of keeping Terraform provider versions consistent across all modules to avoid discrepancies and potential bugs.
- **Security and Features**: 
  - Upgrading provider versions ensures that the infrastructure benefits from the latest security patches and features, which is critical for maintaining a secure and efficient environment.
- **Configuration Management**: 
  - The update to `renovate.json` shows an effort to streamline dependency management by automatically handling non-major updates and keeping pull requests up-to-date.

### Impact Assessment
- **Performance**: 
  - The updated provider versions may include performance improvements, although specific gains would depend on the changes in each provider version.
- **Security**: 
  - Upgrading to newer provider versions likely incorporates security fixes, reducing the attack surface of the infrastructure.
- **Maintainability**: 
  - Consistent provider versions across modules simplify maintenance and reduce the likelihood of version-related bugs.
- **Breaking Changes**: 
  - While the changes are primarily version upgrades, itâ€™s important to test the infrastructure thoroughly to ensure that there are no breaking changes introduced by the new provider versions.

### Developer Notes
- **Testing**: 
  - Ensure to run comprehensive tests after applying these changes to verify that all Terraform configurations work as expected with the new provider versions.
- **Documentation**: 
  - Update any relevant documentation to reflect the new provider versions and configurations.
- **Future Improvements**: 
  - Consider setting up automated checks to regularly update Terraform provider versions to stay current with the latest releases.
