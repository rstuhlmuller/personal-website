### Change Summary
This update introduces automation for container image updates in Argo CD-managed applications, specifically for n8n and open-webui. Key additions include the installation of the Argo CD Image Updater via Helm and configuration annotations to enable semantic versioning (semver)-based updates. Unnecessary features were removed from the development container configuration, and minor cleanups were made to application parameters. These changes enhance deployment automation while simplifying the local development environment.

### Technical Details
- **.devcontainer/devcontainer.json**: Removed the "ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/kubectl-helm-minikube" feature. This eliminates unnecessary tools from the dev container, as they are no longer required for the current setup, potentially streamlining the container's footprint and build time.
  
- **IaC/modules/argocd/main.tf**: Added a new `helm_release` resource named "argocd_image_updater". This installs the Argo CD Image Updater from the official Argo Helm repository (version 0.12.3) into the Argo CD namespace. The resource is configured with `wait = true` to ensure the release completes before proceeding, and an empty values block for default settings. This extends Argo CD's capabilities to automatically detect and apply image updates.

- **IaC/modules/n8n/main.tf**: 
  - Added annotations to the `argocd_application` resource for "n8n":
    - `"argocd-image-updater.argoproj.io/image-list" = "n8n=n8nio/n8n:1.x"`: Specifies the image alias and tag pattern to monitor.
    - `"argocd-image-updater.argoproj.io/n8n.update-strategy" = "semver"`: Enforces semver-based update strategy for controlled versioning.
  - Removed a trailing comment ("// test") from the storage configuration, cleaning up the code without altering functionality.

- **IaC/modules/open-webui/main.tf**:
  - Added similar annotations to the `argocd_application` resource for "open-webui":
    - `"argocd-image-updater.argoproj.io/image-list" = "open-webui=ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:0.x"`: Defines the image to track with a major version pattern.
    - `"argocd-image-updater.argoproj.io/open-webui.update-strategy" = "semver"`: Applies semver strategy for updates.
  - Removed parameters for `image.tag` (set to "latest") and `image.pullPolicy` (set to "Always"). This shifts from manual "latest" tagging to automated updates, reducing the need for explicit image configuration in the Helm chart parameters.

These changes leverage Argo CD's ecosystem for GitOps-driven updates, with no new dependencies beyond the existing Helm and Argo CD setups. No architectural shifts were made, but it integrates a design pattern for automated image management.

### Key Learnings & Insights
The primary motivation was to automate image updates for n8n and open-webui, reducing manual intervention in deployments and ensuring applications stay current with minimal effort. By adopting Argo CD Image Updater, the changes address the common problem of outdated container images in Kubernetes environments, using a GitOps-friendly approach that polls for new versions without external CI pipelines. The semver strategy was chosen to balance automation with stability—preventing disruptive major version jumps while allowing patch and minor updates. This demonstrates best practices in declarative infrastructure (IaC) and continuous deployment, highlighting the trade-off between convenience (auto-updates) and control (potential for unexpected changes). A key lesson is the importance of version pinning (e.g., "1.x" or "0.x") to avoid regressions, learned from past experiences with uncontrolled "latest" tags causing instability.

### Impact Assessment
These changes improve the overall system's maintainability by enabling automated, version-controlled updates for n8n and open-webui, potentially reducing downtime from manual updates and enhancing security through timely patches. Performance implications are minimal, as the updater runs as a lightweight controller within Argo CD, but it could introduce slight overhead from periodic image checks. Security benefits include faster adoption of upstream fixes, though automated updates carry a risk of introducing breaking changes if semver isn't strictly followed by image maintainers. No breaking changes are introduced in this diff, but existing deployments may require a one-time Argo CD sync to apply the new annotations. Migration is straightforward: redeploy the Argo CD module to install the updater, then sync affected applications.

### Developer Notes
- **Gotchas and Edge Cases**: Be cautious with semver strategies—if upstream images don't adhere to semantic versioning, unexpected updates could occur; monitor Argo CD logs for update failures. Edge cases include network issues preventing image registry access, which might stall updates—consider adding custom poll intervals in the updater's values if needed.
- **Context for Future Developers**: This setup assumes Argo CD is already managing applications; extend it to other apps by adding similar annotations, but test in a staging environment first. The removal of devcontainer features simplifies local setup but ensures alternatives like local kubectl/helm installations are available if needed.
- **Potential Future Improvements**: Integrate image updater metrics for monitoring (e.g., via Prometheus), add write-back to Git for true GitOps compliance, or implement approval gates for major updates to mitigate risks. Consider expanding to more applications as the system scales.
