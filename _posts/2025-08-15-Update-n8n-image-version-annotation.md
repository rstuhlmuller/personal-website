### Change Summary
This git diff reflects a version update for the `n8n` application within an Argo CD deployment. Specifically, the `n8nio/n8n` Docker image version has been updated from `1.x` to `1.102.x`.

### Technical Details
- **File Modified:** `IaC/modules/n8n/main.tf`
- **Change Made:** 
  - Updated the annotation `argocd-image-updater.argoproj.io/image-list` from `n8n=n8nio/n8n:1.x` to `n8n=n8nio/n8n:1.102.x`.
- **Resource Affected:** `argocd_application` resource named `n8n`.
- **Annotation Details:**
  - The annotation `argocd-image-updater.argoproj.io/image-list` specifies the Docker image to be used.
  - The annotation `argocd-image-updater.argoproj.io/n8n.update-strategy` is set to `semver`, indicating a semantic versioning update strategy.

### Key Learnings & Insights
- **Version Specificity:** 
  - The change from `1.x` to `1.102.x` indicates a move to a more specific version range. This can help in maintaining consistency across environments and reducing the risk of unexpected changes due to minor version updates.
- **Semantic Versioning:**
  - Using semantic versioning (`semver`) ensures that the application receives compatible updates, minimizing the risk of breaking changes.
- **Automated Updates:**
  - The use of Argo CD’s image updater annotation streamlines the process of keeping dependencies up-to-date, enhancing maintainability.

### Impact Assessment
- **Performance:** 
  - Updating to a newer version may include performance improvements and bug fixes, potentially enhancing the overall performance of the `n8n` application.
- **Security:**
  - Newer versions often include security patches. This update likely improves the security posture of the application.
- **Maintainability:**
  - Specifying a narrower version range (`1.102.x` vs `1.x`) aids in maintaining consistency and predictability in the deployment process.

### Developer Notes
- **Gotchas:**
  - Ensure that the new version `1.102.x` is compatible with the current configuration and dependencies of the `n8n` application.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - Verify that any custom workflows or integrations with `n8n` are not adversely affected by the version update.
- **Future Improvements:**
  - Consider implementing automated testing to validate the application’s functionality post-update. This can help in quickly identifying any issues introduced by new versions.
