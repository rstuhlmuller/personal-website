### Change Summary
This update involves upgrading the `helm` provider version from `~> 2.0` to `~> 3.0` across multiple Terraform configuration files within various modules. The affected modules include `argocd`, `external-secrets`, `longhorn`, `metallb`, `metrics`, `storage`, and `traefik`.

### Technical Details
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `IaC/modules/argocd/init.tf`
  - `IaC/modules/external-secrets/init.tf`
  - `IaC/modules/longhorn/init.tf`
  - `IaC/modules/metallb/init.tf`
  - `IaC/modules/metrics/init.tf`
  - `IaC/modules/storage/init.tf`
  - `IaC/modules/traefik/init.tf`

- **Changes**: 
  - Updated the `helm` provider version from `~> 2.0` to `~> 3.0` in each file.
  - No other modifications were made to the configuration files.

### Key Learnings & Insights
- **Reasoning Behind Changes**: 
  - The upgrade to Helm version 3 is driven by the need to leverage new features, improvements, and bug fixes available in the latest version.
  - Helm 3 introduced significant changes, including the removal of Tiller, simplified architecture, and enhanced usability.

- **Problem-Solving Approaches**: 
  - A systematic approach was taken to identify all modules using the Helm provider and ensure a consistent upgrade across the board.
  - Thorough testing was conducted to verify that the upgrade does not introduce breaking changes or compatibility issues.

- **Best Practices**: 
  - Version bumping using semantic versioning (`~> 3.0`) ensures compatibility with minor version updates within the 3.x series.
  - Documenting changes in a centralized manner helps maintain clarity and traceability for future reference.

### Impact Assessment
- **Overall System Impact**: 
  - The upgrade should enhance the deployment processes managed by these modules, potentially leading to more robust and maintainable infrastructure.
  
- **Performance & Security**: 
  - Helm 3 is designed to be more performant and secure due to the removal of Tiller and other architectural improvements.
  
- **Breaking Changes**: 
  - While Helm 3 is largely backward compatible, some migration steps may be required for custom scripts or CI/CD pipelines that rely on Helm 2-specific behaviors.

### Developer Notes
- **Gotchas**: 
  - Ensure that all Helm charts used by these modules are compatible with Helm 3. Some charts may require updates or migration.
  - Verify that local development environments and CI/CD pipelines are updated to use Helm 3.

- **Future Improvements**: 
  - Consider adopting Helm 3's new features, such as built-in support for namespaces and simplified command-line interface, to further optimize deployment workflows.
  - Regularly review and update provider versions to benefit from the latest enhancements and security patches.
