### Change Summary
This update involves a uniform change across multiple Terraform configuration files within various modules. Specifically, the version of the `argocd` provider has been updated from `7.8.0` to `7.11.2` in all modules that utilize this provider.

### Technical Details
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `IaC/modules/cert-manager/init.tf`
  - `IaC/modules/cloudflare-tunnel/init.tf`
  - `IaC/modules/database/init.tf`
  - `IaC/modules/descheduler/init.tf`
  - `IaC/modules/homarr/init.tf`
  - `IaC/modules/homeassistant/init.tf`
  - `IaC/modules/litellm/init.tf`
  - `IaC/modules/monitoring/init.tf`
  - `IaC/modules/n8n/init.tf`
  - `IaC/modules/octobot/init.tf`
  - `IaC/modules/open-webui/init.tf`
  - `IaC/modules/tailscale/init.tf`
  - `IaC/modules/technitium/init.tf`

- **Change Implemented**: 
  - Updated the `argocd` provider version from `7.8.0` to `7.11.2` in the `required_providers` block of each `init.tf` file.

### Key Learnings & Insights
- **Reasoning Behind the Change**: 
  - The update to version `7.11.2` likely includes bug fixes, performance improvements, and new features that are beneficial for the overall system. Keeping dependencies up-to-date is a best practice to ensure security patches and enhancements are applied.
  
- **Problem-Solving Approach**: 
  - A systematic approach was used to identify all modules dependent on the `argocd` provider and update them uniformly. This ensures consistency across the infrastructure-as-code (IaC) configurations.

- **Best Practices Demonstrated**: 
  - Version management of dependencies is crucial for maintaining a secure and efficient system. This change reflects a proactive approach to dependency management.

### Impact Assessment
- **System-wide Effect**: 
  - The update should enhance the reliability and security of the ArgoCD deployments across all modules. It may also introduce new functionalities or improvements that can be leveraged in future developments.

- **Performance & Security**: 
  - Potential performance improvements and security patches included in `7.11.2` will positively impact the system. However, it is essential to review the release notes for any breaking changes that might require additional adjustments.

- **Breaking Changes**: 
  - Developers should review the ArgoCD release notes for version `7.11.2` to identify any breaking changes that may necessitate code modifications or configuration updates.

### Developer Notes
- **Gotchas & Edge Cases**: 
  - Ensure that all environments (development, staging, production) are updated to the new version to avoid inconsistencies.
  - Verify that existing configurations and scripts compatible with the new version.
  
- **Future Improvements**: 
  - Consider implementing a version management strategy that automates dependency updates, reducing the manual effort required for such changes in the future.
  - Regularly review and update all providers and modules to their latest versions to maintain system health and security.
