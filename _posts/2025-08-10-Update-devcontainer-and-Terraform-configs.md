### Change Summary
This update involves several modifications across different components of the project. Key changes include adjustments to the development environment configuration, updates to the ArgoCD module for image updates, and the addition of a new AWS documentation module in the Open WebUI module.

### Technical Details
- **Development Environment Configuration**:
  - File: `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`
  - Removed extensions: `hashicorp.terraform`, `GitHub.copilot`, `GitHub.copilot-chat`, `eamodio.gitlens`
  - Retained extension: `hashicorp.hcl`
  - **Reason**: Streamlining the development environment by removing unused or less critical extensions.

- **ArgoCD Module Update**:
  - File: `IaC/modules/argocd/main.tf`
  - Changed interval for `argocd_image_updater` from `6h` to `1h`.
  - **Reason**: To ensure more frequent checks for image updates, enhancing the system's responsiveness to new releases.

- **Open WebUI Module Enhancement**:
  - File: `IaC/modules/open-webui/main.tf`
  - Added a new module `awslabs.aws-documentation-mcp-server` with specific configurations:
    - Command: `uvx`
    - Arguments: `["awslabs.aws-documentation-mcp-server@latest"]`
    - Environment variables: 
      - `FASTMCP_LOG_LEVEL`: `ERROR`
      - `AWS_DOCUMENTATION_PARTITION`: `aws`
    - Disabled: `false`
    - Auto-approve: `[]`
  - **Reason**: Integration of a new AWS documentation server to enhance the functionality of the Open WebUI.

### Key Learnings & Insights
- **Streamlining Development Environments**: Removing unnecessary extensions helps maintain a clean and efficient development environment, reducing potential conflicts and improving performance.
- **Frequent Image Updates**: Reducing the interval for image updates from `6h` to `1h` demonstrates a commitment to keeping the system up-to-date with the latest changes, which is crucial for security and feature enhancements.
- **Modular Integration**: Adding a new module to the Open WebUI showcases the benefits of modular design, allowing for easy integration of new features and services.

### Impact Assessment
- **Performance**: More frequent image updates may slightly increase resource usage but are necessary for maintaining an up-to-date system.
- **Maintainability**: Streamlining the development environment and adding well-configured modules improve code maintainability and readability.
- **Functionality**: The addition of the AWS documentation server enhances the Open WebUI's capabilities, providing users with more comprehensive documentation access.

### Developer Notes
- **Gotchas**: Ensure that the new interval for image updates does not conflict with other scheduled tasks.
- **Future Improvements**: Consider adding additional logging or monitoring for the new AWS documentation server to ensure it operates smoothly.
- **Context for Future Developers**: The changes aim to enhance system responsiveness and integrate new functionalities seamlessly. Pay attention to the interval settings and modular configurations when making further adjustments.
