### Change Summary
This git diff introduces a minor but intentional update to the greeting message in the `main.py` file. The change modifies the output of the `hello()` function from "Hello World" to "Hello, World!", adding a comma for better punctuation. No new files, dependencies, or structural changes were added or removed; this is a straightforward string adjustment.

### Technical Details
- **File Affected: main.py**
  - The change occurs in the `hello()` function.
  - Original line: `print("Hello World")`
  - Updated line: `print("Hello, World!")`
  - This is a simple modification to the string literal passed to the `print` function, with no alterations to function logic, parameters, or control flow.
- No architectural changes, design patterns, or dependencies were involved. The code remains a basic Python script with no external configurations or environment impacts.

### Key Learnings & Insights
- The change addresses a common oversight in string formatting, emphasizing the importance of attention to detail in user-facing outputs for improved readability and professionalism.
- Reasoning: Without the comma, the greeting could appear incomplete or informal; adding it aligns with standard English punctuation rules, demonstrating how small tweaks can enhance user experience.
- Best practices: This exemplifies the principle of "sweat the small stuff" in code maintenance, using version control for even minor fixes to track history. It also highlights the value of code reviews for catching such details.
- Trade-offs: The update is negligible in terms of performance but prioritizes clarity over brevity; no complex decisions were needed here, but it could serve as a reminder to consider internationalization (e.g., for non-English greetings) in future iterations.

### Impact Assessment
- **System Impact**: The change affects only the console output of the script, with no ripple effects on other components, modules, or system behavior. The program continues to run as a standalone hello-world example.
- **Performance/Security/Maintainability**: No performance overhead; security is unaffected as it's a static string change. Maintainability improves slightly by making the code more polished and easier to read.
- **Breaking Changes**: None; this is fully backward-compatible. No migrations are required, though users running the script will notice the updated output.

### Developer Notes
- **Gotchas/Edge Cases**: Be mindful of string encoding if this script is extended to support multilingual outputsâ€”UTF-8 should handle the comma fine, but test in different environments.
- **Context for Future Developers**: This fix sets a precedent for consistent formatting in print statements; consider refactoring to use f-strings or logging for more robust output handling in production scenarios.
- **Potential Improvements**: Add unit tests for the `hello()` function to verify output (e.g., using pytest). Explore parameterizing the greeting for customizability, or integrate with a UI framework for broader applications.
