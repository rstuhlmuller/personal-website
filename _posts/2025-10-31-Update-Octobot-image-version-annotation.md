### Change Summary
This change updates the version specification for the `octobot` image in the `main.tf` file within the `IaC/modules/octobot` directory. The version specification has been changed from `2.x` to `2.0.x`.

### Technical Details
- **File Modified:** `IaC/modules/octobot/main.tf`
- **Change:** 
  - The annotation `argocd-image-updater.argoproj.io/image-list` for the `octobot` resource has been updated.
  - Original: `"octobot=drakkarsoftware/octobot:2.x"`
  - Updated: `"octobot=drakkarsoftware/octobot:2.0.x"`
- **Implementation:** 
  - This change specifies a more precise version range for the `octobot` image, ensuring that only versions within the `2.0.x` range are considered for updates.

### Key Learnings & Insights
- **Reasoning:** 
  - The change aims to narrow down the version range to ensure compatibility and stability. By specifying `2.0.x`, we avoid potential breaking changes that might be introduced in the `2.x` range, which could include versions like `2.1.0` or higher.
- **Problem-Solving Approach:** 
  - The team identified that broader version ranges (`2.x`) could lead to unexpected behavior due to significant changes between minor versions. Thus, locking down to `2.0.x` mitigates this risk.
- **Best Practices:** 
  - Itâ€™s a best practice to use specific version ranges in dependency management to avoid unforeseen issues due to major or minor version updates.
- **Trade-offs:** 
  - The trade-off is that this approach might delay receiving updates that fall outside the `2.0.x` range, requiring manual intervention to update the version range when ready to adopt newer versions.

### Impact Assessment
- **System Impact:** 
  - This change ensures that the `octobot` service will only pull images within the `2.0.x` range, promoting stability and reducing the risk of introducing breaking changes.
- **Performance & Security:** 
  - No direct performance or security implications are expected from this change. However, it enhances maintainability by ensuring that the service operates within a known, stable version range.
- **Breaking Changes:** 
  - There are no breaking changes introduced by this update. However, future updates to the `octobot` image outside the `2.0.x` range will require manual version range updates in this file.

### Developer Notes
- **Gotchas:** 
  - Ensure that any future updates to the `octobot` image within the `2.0.x` range are thoroughly tested before deployment.
- **Edge Cases:** 
  - Be cautious when updating the version range in the future. Verify that the new range does not introduce breaking changes or incompatibilities.
- **Future Improvements:** 
  - Consider implementing a CI/CD pipeline step that automatically tests new image versions within the specified range before deployment.
