### Change Summary
This git diff reflects a significant update across multiple Terraform modules and their corresponding lock files. The primary change is the upgrade of the Helm provider from version 2.0 to version 3.0. This update affects several modules including `argocd`, `external-secrets`, `longhorn`, `metallb`, `metrics`, `storage`, and `traefik`.

### Technical Details
- **Files Modified:**
  - `IaC/modules/{module}/init.tf` for each module listed above.
  - Corresponding `.terraform.lock.hcl` files in the `IaC/production/homelab/{module}/` directory.
  
- **Changes per File:**
  - In each `init.tf` file, the Helm provider version was updated from `~> 2.0` to `~> 3.0`.
  - In each `.terraform.lock.hcl` file, the Helm provider version was updated from `2.17.0` to `3.0.2`, along with the corresponding hash changes.

### Key Learnings & Insights
- **Reasoning Behind Changes:**
  - The upgrade to Helm 3 is likely driven by the need for newer features, bug fixes, or security patches available in the latest version.
  - Helm 3 removes Tiller, simplifies the overall architecture, and improves the user experience.

- **Problem-Solving Approaches:**
  - A systematic approach was taken to update the provider version across all relevant modules to ensure consistency and reduce the risk of version mismatches.

- **Best Practices Demonstrated:**
  - Version locking in Terraform using `~>` ensures compatibility while allowing for minor version upgrades.
  - Updating lock files ensures that the exact versions are used in different environments, maintaining consistency.

### Impact Assessment
- **Overall System Impact:**
  - The upgrade should bring improvements and new features provided by Helm 3, potentially enhancing the deployment and management of Kubernetes applications.
  
- **Performance, Security, and Maintainability:**
  - Performance may improve due to optimizations in Helm 3.
  - Security should be enhanced with the latest patches.
  - Maintainability is likely to improve with a more modern and supported version of Helm.

- **Breaking Changes or Migration Requirements:**
  - Teams should be aware of any breaking changes introduced in Helm 3 and plan accordingly for migration.
  - Documentation and testing should be updated to reflect the new version.

### Developer Notes
- **Gotchas and Edge Cases:**
  - Ensure that all Helm charts used in the project are compatible with Helm 3.
  - Be mindful of any deprecated features or changed commands in Helm 3.

- **Context for Future Developers:**
  - This upgrade was necessary to leverage the benefits of Helm 3 and should be considered a baseline for future developments.

- **Areas for Potential Future Improvements:**
  - Continuously monitor for new Helm versions and plan for timely upgrades.
  - Automate the process of updating provider versions where possible to reduce manual effort and errors.
