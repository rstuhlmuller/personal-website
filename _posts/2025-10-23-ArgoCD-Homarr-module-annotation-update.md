### Change Summary
This git diff introduces changes to the `main.tf` file within the `homarr` module of the Infrastructure as Code (IaC) repository. The primary modification is the addition of annotations to the `argocd_application` resource for the Homarr application. These annotations configure the Argo CD image updater to manage image updates automatically.

### Technical Details
- **File Modified:** `IaC/modules/homarr/main.tf`
- **Resource Affected:** `argocd_application` named "homarr"
- **Added Annotations:**
  - `argocd-image-updater.argoproj.io/image-list`: Specifies the Docker image for Homarr as `ghcr.io/homarr-labs/homarr:v1`.
  - `argocd-image-updater.argoproj.io/homarr.update-strategy`: Sets the update strategy to `semver`, indicating that semantic versioning will be used for updates.

### Key Learnings & Insights
- **Automation of Image Updates:** The addition of these annotations leverages Argo CD's image updater to automate the process of pulling new Docker images for the Homarr application. This reduces manual intervention and ensures that the application stays up-to-date with the latest releases.
- **Semantic Versioning:** Using semantic versioning (`semver`) as the update strategy ensures that only compatible updates are applied, minimizing the risk of breaking changes.
- **Configuration as Code:** This change exemplifies the principle of configuration as code, where infrastructure and application configurations are managed through version-controlled files.

### Impact Assessment
- **Positive Impacts:**
  - **Reduced Manual Effort:** Automates the process of updating Docker images, saving time and reducing the potential for human error.
  - **Enhanced Maintainability:** Ensures that the application remains up-to-date with minimal manual intervention.
  - **Improved Reliability:** Semantic versioning helps maintain compatibility and stability by avoiding breaking changes.
- **Potential Risks:**
  - **Unexpected Updates:** Automatic updates might introduce new features or changes that were not thoroughly tested in the current environment. It is crucial to monitor updates and have rollback procedures in place.

### Developer Notes
- **Monitoring:** Ensure that the Argo CD image updater is monitored for any unexpected behavior or issues post-deployment.
- **Rollback Plan:** Have a rollback plan in place to revert to the previous image version if an update causes issues.
- **Testing:** Consider implementing automated testing to validate the application after an image update.
- **Future Improvements:** Explore additional configuration options for the Argo CD image updater to further refine the update process, such as specifying allowed update windows or notification mechanisms for updates.
