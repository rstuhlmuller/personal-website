### Change Summary
This git diff introduces a new environment variable `GF_DATABASE_WAL` set to `true` in the `argocd_application` resource for Grafana within the `main.tf` file. This change is aimed at enhancing the performance and reliability of the Grafana database by enabling Write-Ahead Logging (WAL).

### Technical Details
- **File Modified:** `IaC/modules/monitoring/main.tf`
- **Resource:** `argocd_application` named "grafana"
- **Added Environment Variable:** `GF_DATABASE_WAL` with value `true`

The specific change is as follows:
```diff
@@ -78,6 +78,7 @@ resource "argocd_application" "grafana" {
           env = {
             GF_SERVER_ROOT_URL = "https://grafana.stinkyboi.com/"
+            GF_DATABASE_WAL    = true
           }
         })
       }
```

### Key Learnings & Insights
- **Performance Improvement:** Enabling `GF_DATABASE_WAL` enhances Grafana's database performance by ensuring that data is written to a log file before being committed to the database. This reduces the risk of data loss and improves transaction reliability.
- **Configuration Management:** This change demonstrates the importance of managing configuration through Infrastructure as Code (IaC). By adding the environment variable in `main.tf`, we ensure that the configuration is version-controlled and consistently applied across environments.
- **Best Practices:** Using environment variables to configure application settings is a best practice. It allows for easy adjustments without modifying the codebase, promoting flexibility and maintainability.

### Impact Assessment
- **Performance:** The primary impact is a potential performance boost in Grafanaâ€™s database operations due to the WAL mechanism.
- **Maintainability:** This change improves maintainability by centralizing configuration in the `main.tf` file, making it easier for future adjustments.
- **No Breaking Changes:** There are no breaking changes introduced by this modification. However, ensure that the Grafana version supports the `GF_DATABASE_WAL` environment variable.

### Developer Notes
- **Gotchas:** Ensure that the Grafana instance is configured to handle WAL, and verify that there are no conflicts with existing database settings.
- **Edge Cases:** Monitor the Grafana logs for any unexpected behavior post-deployment, especially concerning database performance and transaction handling.
- **Future Improvements:** Consider adding additional monitoring to track the performance impact of WAL and explore other Grafana configuration options that could further optimize database operations.
